It relies on content analysis of 3,387 articles and opinion pieces in leading newspapers from eight Western countries, compiled into the Darfur Media Dataset, as well as in-depth interviews to assess how media frame violence in the Darfur region of Sudan. Overall, it finds that UN Security Council and International Criminal Court interventions increase representations of mass violence as crime in all countries under investigation, although each country applies the crime frame at a different level. Reporting suffering and categorizing the violence as genocide also varies across countries. Comparative case studies identify country specific structural and cultural forces that appear to account for these differences. Multilevel multivariate analyses confirm the explanatory power of cultural sensitivities and policy practices, while individualand organization-level factors, such as reporters\u2019 gender and the newspapers\u2019 ideological orientation, also have explanatory power.","DOI":"10.1086\/682403"},{"Year":2017,"Source title":"American Journal of Sociology","Title":"Matching genotype and phenotype: A pragmatist semiotic analysis of clinical exome sequencing","Abstract":"Based on three years of ethnographic research, the author examines how laboratory geneticists using next-generation genomic sequencing technologies causally linkapatient\u2019s genotypeandphenotype.

While previous work has focused on the ethnic composition of student bodies, this study places schools in their institutional and local contexts. The authors argue that the formation of identities and networks varies across local areas depending on the extent of ethnic stratification across schools. Empirically, the authors turn to the case of Germany, where the role of schools as producers of categorical inequalities is particularly obvious. The analysis links large-scale survey data on adolescents\u2019 identification and networks with administrative geocoded information on local stratification across secondary schools. The authors find that minority students in schools with identical ethnic compositions show different inclinations to identify as a majority group member and to form friendships with majority peers, depending on the local extent of ethnic stratification across schools. To place these findings in a cross-national perspective, the authors identify scope conditions of these mechanisms of boundary making and discuss their presence in other countries and school systems. The results support recent theories of immigrant incorporation and offer a more contextualized understanding of ethnic boundary making in schools.","DOI":"10.1086\/705561"},{"Year":2014,"Source title":"American Journal of Sociology","Title":"Who is black, white, or mixed race?

This article addresses this question using a unique longitudinal data set from Nepal and provides the first individual-level test of developmental idealism theory. The authors find that unmarried individuals with greater endorsement of developmental idealism in 2008 were more likely by 2012 to choose their own spouse, including a spouse of a different caste, rather than have an arranged marriage. Those with salaried work experience were also less likely to have arranged marriages, but urban proximity and education were not significant.

However, little is known about the mechanisms that allowed for European upward advancement. This article begins to fill this gap by analyzing how naturalization policies influenced the economic success of immigrants across generations. Specifically, the author creates new panel data sets that follow immigrants and their children across complete-count U.S. censuses to understand the economic consequences of citizenship attainment. The author finds that naturalization raised occupational attainment for the first generation that then allowed children to have greater educational attainment and labor market success. He argues that economic progress was conditioned by political statuses for European-origin groups during the first half of the 20th century.","DOI":"10.1086\/701297"},{"Year":2014,"Source title":"American Journal of Sociology","Title":"The new immigration contestation: Social movements and local immigration policy making in the United States, 2000\u20132011","Abstract":"Analyzing oppositional social movements in the context of municipal immigration ordinances, the authors examine whether the explanatory power of resource mobilization, political process, and strain theories of social movements\u2019 impact on policy outcomes differs when considering proactive as opposed to reactive movements.

Exploitation, profit, and risk in rental markets","Abstract":"This article examines tenant exploitation and landlord profit margins within residential rental markets. Defining exploitation as being overcharged relative to the market value of a property, the authors find exploitation of tenants to be highest in poor neighborhoods. Landlords in poor neighborhoods also extract higher profits from housing units. Property values and tax burdens are considerably lower in depressed residential areas, but rents are not. Because landlords operating in poor communities face more risks, they hedge their position by raising rents on all tenants, carrying the weight of social structure into price. Since losses are rare, landlords typically realize the surplus risk charge as higher profits. Promoting a relational approach to the analysis of inequality, this study demonstrates how the market strategies of landlords contribute to high rent burdens in low-income neighborhoods.","DOI":"10.1086\/701697"},{"Year":2019,"Source title":"American Journal of Sociology","Title":"The world system and the hollowing out of state capacity: How structural adjustment programs affect bureaucratic quality in developing countries","Abstract":"The administrative ability of the state to deliver effective policy is essential for economic development.

Measuring social distance separately from cognitive distance and distinctiveness independently from critical acclaim, the authors test their hypothesis about structural folding and cognitive diversity by analyzing team reassembly for 12,422 video games and the career histories of 139,727 video game developers. When combined with cognitive distance, structural folding channels and mobilizes a productive tension of rules, roles, and codes that promotes successful innovation. In addition to serving as pipes and prisms, network ties are also the source of tools and tensions.","DOI":"10.1086\/681213"},{"Year":2015,"Source title":"American Journal of Sociology","Title":"Go with your gut: Emotion and evaluation in job interviews","Abstract":"This article presents hiring as an emotional process rooted in interpersonal evaluation.

How the status attainment process shapes attributions of considerateness and authenticity","Abstract":"This article develops and tests a theory to explain the common tendency to \u201cdenigrate heroes,\u201d whereby high-status actors are suspected of being inconsiderate and inauthentic relative to low-status counterparts. This tendency is argued to reflect two conditions typical of status attainment processes: (a) assertions of superiority over others and (b) the presence of incentives to pursue status. The latter is key since awareness of such incentives breeds suspicions of inauthenticity, which in turn undermine perceptions of prosocial intentions. This theory is validated in a series of online experiments, in which categorical status hierarchies emerge either via deference on a coordinated task or via competitive interactions. Results show that high-status actors may also be \u201ccelebrated\u201d as authentic and considerate when the observable incentive structure is such that assertions of superiority appear as unintended by-products of prosocial action. Implications are drawn regarding the sources of instability and insecurity in status hierarchies.","DOI":"10.1086\/678304"},{"Year":2017,"Source title":"American Journal of Sociology","Title":"From legal doctrine to social transformation?

Social scientists commonly point to two modes of global-level institutional change: formal and fundamental transformations, like renegotiated treaties, or informal and incremental changes of a modest nature.

Relying on archival material and interviews, the authors show that fundamental-yet-informal change was effected through a process of norm substitution\u2014the alteration of everyday assumptions about the appropriateness of a set of activities.

Therefore, same-ethnic friendship preferences, or ethnic homophily, can work at cross-purposes with policy recommendations to diversify ethnic representation in social settings. In order to effectively overcome ethnic segregation, we need to identify those factors within diverse settings that exacerbate the tendency toward ethnic homophily. Using unique data and multiple network analyses, the authors examine 529 adolescent friendship networks in English, German, Dutch, and Swedish schools and find that the ethnic composition of school classes relates differently to immigrant and native homophily. Immigrant homophily disproportionately increases as immigrants see more same-ethnic peers, and friendship density among natives has no effect on this. By contrast, native homophily remains relatively low until natives see dense groups of immigrants.

Results indicate that between-class income differences grew by about 60% since the 1980s and that the relative size of different classes remained fairly stable. A formal decomposition analysis indicates that changes in the relative size of different social classes had a small dampening effect and that growth in between-class income differences had a large inflationary effect on trends in personal income inequality.","DOI":"10.1086\/684273"},{"Year":2015,"Source title":"American Journal of Sociology","Title":"The cost of color: Skin color, discrimination, and health among African-Americans","Abstract":"In this study, the author uses a nationally representative survey to examine the relationship(s) between skin tone, discrimination, and health among African-Americans. He finds that skin tone is a significant predictor of multiple forms of perceived discrimination (including perceived skin color discrimination from whites and blacks) and, in turn, these forms of perceived discrimination are significant predictors of key health outcomes, such as depression and self-rated mental and physical health. Intraracial health differences related to skin tone (and discrimination) often rival or even exceed disparities between blacks and whites as a whole. The author also finds that selfreported skin tone, conceptualized as a form of embodied social status, is a stronger predictor of perceived discrimination than interviewerrated skin tone. He discusses the implications of these findings for the study of ethnoracial health disparities and highlights the utility of cognitive andmultidimensional approaches to ethnoracial and social inequality.","DOI":"10.1086\/682162"},{"Year":2020,"Source title":"American Journal of Sociology","Title":"Rethinking religion: Toward a practice approach","Abstract":"Over the last three decades, fruitful new lines of research and theorizing have revealed the inadequacy of secularization and rational choice explanations of religion.

The authors study variation in social integration in the first months after prison release with data from the Boston Reentry Study, a unique panel survey of 122 newly released prisoners. The data indicate severe material hardship immediately after incarceration. Over half of sample respondents were unemployed, two-thirds received public assistance, and many relied on female relatives for financial support and housing. Older respondents and those with histories of addiction and mental illness were the least socially integrated, with weak family ties, unstable housing, and low levels of employment. Qualitative interviews show that anxiety and feelings of isolation accompanied extreme material insecurity. Material insecurity combined with the adjustment to social life outside prison creates a stress of transition that burdens social relationships in high-incarceration communities.","DOI":"10.1086\/681301"},{"Year":2016,"Source title":"American Journal of Sociology","Title":"And their children after them?

This method is applied to the 2000 ANES data, which have been used to argue that political beliefs are organized around parenting schemas. This structural approach instead yields results consistent with the central role of political identity, which individuals may use as the organizing heuristic to filter information from the political field. In light of recent accounts of belief system heterogeneity, a search for population heterogeneity in this organizing logic was undertaken first by comparing 44 demographic subpopulations and then using inductive techniques. Contra these recent accounts, the study finds that belief systems of different groups vary in the amount of organization but not in the logic that organizes them.","DOI":"10.1086\/691274"},{"Year":2018,"Source title":"American Journal of Sociology","Title":"Emotions and knowledge in expert work: A comparison of two psychotherapies","Abstract":"Knowledge practices, expert and nonexpert alike, have received increased scholarly attention, but their affective underpinnings remain little understood.

Migration, social institutions, and collective action in rural China","Abstract":"This article integrates literature on social movements and migration to examine how migration shapes both the cognitive and social foundations of collective action in origin communities. Using longitudinal data and in-depth interviews from rural China, the author finds that outward migration spurs collective resistance in origin communities and shapes the form and scale of collective action. Migration fosters noninstitutionalized rather than institutionalized collective action, because it induces relational diffusion that empowers peasants to mobilize and employ more effective resistance strategies. This holds more for small-and medium-size collective action than for large-scale mobilizations, mainly because out-migration can also trigger community disintegration that inhibits larger-scale action. Furthermore, local social institutions condition the role of migration: migration has a stronger positive impact in close-knit villages embedded in strong lineage networks than in less cohesive villages. The author contextualizes the findings against the distinct institutional arrangements in China, which were originally engineered to disenfranchise rural-origin people but which instead have inadvertently politicized migrants and peasants alike.","DOI":"10.1086\/706755"},{"Year":2016,"Source title":"American Journal of Sociology","Title":"Parenthood and happiness: Effects of work-family reconciliation policies in 22 OECD countries","Abstract":"The recent proliferation of studies examining cross-national variation in the association between parenthood and happiness reveal accumulating evidence of lower levels of happiness among parents than nonparents in most advanced industrialized societies.

The association between diversity and trust is better explained by differences between communities and their residents in terms of race\/ethnicity, residential stability, and economic conditions; these classic indicators of inequality, not diversity, strongly and consistently predict self-reported trust. Diversity indexes also obscure the distinction between in-group and out-group contact. For whites, heterogeneity means more out-group neighbors; for nonwhites, heterogeneity means more in-group neighbors. Therefore, separate analyses were conducted by ethnoracial groups. Only for whites does living among out-group members\u2014not in diverse communities per se\u2014negatively predict trust.","DOI":"10.1086\/683144"},{"Year":2014,"Source title":"American Journal of Sociology","Title":"When politics froze fashion: The effect of the cultural revolution on naming in Beijing","Abstract":"The authors examine the popularity of boys\u2019 given names in Beijing before and after the onset of the Cultural Revolution to clarify how exogenous and endogenous factors interact to shape fashion. Whereas recent work in the sociology of culture emphasizes the importance of endogenous processes in explaining fashion, their analysis demonstrates two ways in which politics shaped cultural expression during the Cultural Revolution: by promoting forms of expression reflecting prevailing political ideology and by limiting individuals\u2019 willingness to act differently. As argued by Lieberson and developed further in this article, the second condition is important because endogenous fashion cycles require a critical mass of individuals who seek to differentiate themselves from common practice. Exogenous factors can influence the operation of the endogenous factors.

Using multilevel meta-regression models, they find that brother correlations in status decreased slowly from about 1860 onward. Although this exactly parallels the period of modernization, the authors find that modernization processes were not responsible (except possibly urbanization and mass transportation). In fact, in line with dualism theory, fraternal resemblance increased with most processes (i.e., industrialization, educational expansion, in-migration, and mass communication) because they amplified inequality.","DOI":"10.1086\/679104"},{"Year":2018,"Source title":"American Journal of Sociology","Title":"Faulkner\u2019s assembly of memories into history: Narrative networks in multiple times","Abstract":"In Absalom, Absalom!

Relative to the mass consumers that defined the post\u2013World War II U.S. economy, high-income consumers are willing to pay for high-quality and high-status products. These spending patterns split producers into up-market and down-market segments and stoke winner-take-all dynamics among up-market producers. Economic dependence on highincome consumers could thus lead to a new form of industrial segmentation, based on vertical differentiation by product quality or status. To test these predictions, data from consumer expenditure and wage surveys are linked using input-output tables and used to fit variance function regressions. Results show that industries more dependent on high-income consumers have greater wage inequality. This analysis identifies a new structural source of wage inequality not considered in previous research: the increasingly unequal composition of consumer demand reproduces wage inequality.","DOI":"10.1086\/692063"},{"Year":2020,"Source title":"American Journal of Sociology","Title":"What do historical sociologists do all day?

As abolitionism rose, nonslavers in that public network gained relatively more influence than slavers, but the reverse was true in the private network of an elite social club.

In particular, he shows how one community of radical environmental activists make affirming moral identities centered on living \u201cnaturally\u201d seem like \u201csecond nature,\u201d even in a seemingly unnatural and immoral urban environment, by reconfiguring their physicalworld. The author shows how nonhuman objects serve as proofs of moral labor, markers of moral boundaries, and reminders of moral values, playing both a facilitating and constraining role in moral life.","DOI":"10.1086\/683819"},{"Year":2020,"Source title":"American Journal of Sociology","Title":"With friends like these: Aggression from amity and equivalence","Abstract":"Some teenagers are willing to bully, harass, and torment their schoolmates in order to achieve popularity and other goals.

To the extent that friendships are the currency of social status, we should expect social aspirants to target their own friends, their friends\u2019 friends, and other structurally equivalent schoolmates. This tendency, we argue, extends beyond what would be explained by propinquity, and we expect that victimization by friends will be particularly distressing. We test these hypotheses using panel social network data from 14 middle and high schools at two time points during a school year. Findings from temporal exponential random graph models suggest that our expectations are correct: the tendency to be cruel to friends is not significantly influenced by propinquity, and victimization by friends has adverse consequences for mental health.","DOI":"10.1086\/712972"},{"Year":2014,"Source title":"American Journal of Sociology","Title":"Classification and coercion: The destruction of piracy in the English maritime system","Abstract":"The article argues that coordinated state action depends not just on organizational forms and institutions but also on \u201ccultural infrastructures,\u201d systems of state meaning making.

In ROOM, the environmental influence was measured by the precollege drinking behavior of randomly assigned roommates. Random assignment safeguards against friend selection and removes the threat of gene-environment correlation that makes gene-environment interaction effects difficult to interpret. On average, being randomly assigned a drinking peer as opposed to a nondrinking peer increased college binge drinking by 0.5-1.0 episodes per month, or 20%-40% the average amount of binge drinking. However, this peer influence was found only among youths with a medium level of genetic propensity for alcohol use; those with either a low or high genetic propensity were not influenced by peer drinking. A replication of the findings is provided in data drawn from Add Health.

He tests this theory using data from 27 countries and 25 states in Brazil. He finds that colonial demography, not colonizer cultural legacies, best accounts for contemporary racial schemas. As such, he concludes that the importance of colonizer identity to racial formation has been overstated and that national racial ideologies are best understood as the endogenous product of differences in colonial European settlement.

In noncompetitive contexts, the authors observe both logics of reciprocation, dependence in the short term and embedding over the long term, developing into population-level generalized exchange.

Using data from the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism, the influence of gender, social integration, and genetic risk on nicotine and alcoholdependence is examined.Three-way interaction models reveal gender-specific moderation of interactions between genetic risk score and social integration.Namely, being currently married and reporting positive social psychological integration are predictive of reduced risk of nicotine dependence among men with genetic susceptibility to strong nicotine cravings in the presence of social cues like stress. In contrast, the protective effects of marital status and social integration are substantially attenuated and absent, respectively, among womenwith high-risk genotypes. This pattern reflects the dualism i.e., simultaneous costs and benefits inherent in social integration for women, which may disproportionately affect those with a genetic sensitivity to stress.

Using 30 years of nationally representative panel data and propensity score matching methods, the authors find significant negative effects of job displacement among single mothers on children\u2019s educational attainment and social-psychological well-being in young adulthood. Effects are concentrated among older children and children whose mothers had a low likelihood of displacement, suggesting an important role for social stigma and relative deprivation in the effects of socioeconomic shocks on child well-being.","DOI":"10.1086\/675409"},{"Year":2017,"Source title":"American Journal of Sociology","Title":"Rethinking the risks of poverty: A framework for analyzing prevalences and penalties","Abstract":"This article develops a framework for analyzing the risks of poverty in terms of prevalences (share of the population with a risk) and penalties (increased probability of poverty associated with a risk). A comparison of the four major risks (low education, single motherhood, young headship, and unemployment) across 29 rich democracies reveals there is greater variation in penalties than prevalences. The United States has high poverty partly because it has the highest penalties despite below average prevalences. Also, U.S. poverty in 2013 would be worse with prevalences from 1970 or 1980. There is little evidence that penalties discourage prevalences, while welfare generosity significantly moderates the penalties for unemployment and low education. The authors conclude that a focus on risks does not provide a convincing explanation of poverty, single motherhood may be the least important of the risks, and studies based solely on the United States are constrained by potentially large sample selection biases.","DOI":"10.1086\/693678"},{"Year":2016,"Source title":"American Journal of Sociology","Title":"Politics and economic stratification: Power resources and income inequality in the United States","Abstract":"What factors best explain the U.S. growth in economic stratification since the late 1970s?

The authors propose a network approach to address these challenges. The approach conceptualizes the occupational system as a network, in which the nodes are occupations and the edges are defined by the volume and direction of workers who move between the nodes. A flow-based community detection algorithm is introduced to uncover mobility boundaries based on the observed mobility network. Applying this approach to analyze trends in intragenerational occupational mobility in the United States from 1989 to 2015, the authors find that the boundaries that constrain mobility opportunities have become increasingly rigid over time, while, at the same time, decoupled from the boundaries of big classes and microclasses.

Our study investigates the mechanisms promoting cooperation in an online-auction market where most transactions can be conceived as one-time-only exchanges. We first give a systematic account of the theoretical arguments explaining the process of cooperative transactions. Then, using a large dataset comprising 14,627 mobile phone auctions and 339,517 DVD auctions, we test key hypotheses about the effects of traders' reputations on auction outcomes and traders' motives for leaving feedback. Our statistical analyses show that sellers with better reputations have higher sales and obtain higher prices. Furthermore, we observe a high rate of participation in the feedback system, which is largely consistent with strong reciprocity-a predisposition to unconditionally reward (or punish) one's interaction partner's cooperation (or defection)-and altruism-a predisposition to increase one's own utility by elevating an interaction partner's utility.

We argue that a durable racial hierarchy governs residential selection and, in turn, gentrifying neighborhoods. Integrating census data, police records, prior street-level observations, community surveys, proximity to amenities, and city budget data on capital investments, we find that the pace of gentrification in Chicago from 2007 to 2009 was negatively associated with the concentration of blacks and Latinos in neighborhoods that either showed signs of gentrification or were adjacent and still disinvested in 1995. Racial composition has a threshold effect, however, attenuating gentrification when the share of blacks in a neighborhood is greater than 40 percent. Consistent with theories of neighborhood stigma, we also find that collective perceptions of disorder, which are higher in poor minority neighborhoods, deter gentrification, while observed disorder does not. These results help explain the reproduction of neighborhood racial inequality amid urban transformation.","DOI":"10.1177\/0003122414535774"},{"Year":2017,"Source title":"American Sociological Review","Title":"Demonstrating Power: How Protest Persuades Political Representatives","Abstract":"How do public opinion signals affect political representatives\u2019 opinion formation?

Elected officials were exposed to manipulated television news items covering a protest demonstration. Following Tilly\u2019s previously untested WUNC claim, four features of the event were manipulated: the demonstrators\u2019 worthiness, unity, numerical strength, and commitment. We argue that these protest features present elected officials with useful cues about what (a segment of) the public wants. We find that these cues affect elected officials\u2019 beliefs. The salience they attach to the protest issue, the position they take, and their intended actions all change as a consequence of exposure.

This study examines the passage of municipal ordinances prohibiting gas development using hydraulic fracturing (\u201cfracking\u201d) in New York State. I argue that local action against fracking depended on multiple conceptions of the shale gas industry. Matching these alternative conceptions with prevailing spatial models of public response to industrial land uses\u2014\u201cnot in my backyard,\u201d \u201cnot in anyone\u2019s backyard,\u201d and \u201cplease in my backyard\u201d\u2014improves our understanding of where local contention might emerge and how it contributes to policy change. Results from event history and logistic regression analyses show, first, that communities lying above favorable areas of the shale did not pass anti-fracking laws because opposition to fracking was counteracted by significant local support for development. Fracking bans passed primarily in a geographic sweet spot on the periphery of targeted regions, where little or no compelling economic interest in development existed. Second, as fracking became the subject of a highly politicized national debate, local opposition increasingly reflected mobilization by political liberals. This trend is reflected in the increasing rate of ordinance adoption among Democratic-leaning communities outside the geographic sweet spot.","DOI":"10.1177\/0003122416663929"},{"Year":2018,"Source title":"American Sociological Review","Title":"Immigrants\u2019 Economic Assimilation: Evidence from Longitudinal Earnings Records","Abstract":"We examine immigrants\u2019 earnings trajectories and measure the extent and speed with which they are able to reduce the earnings gap with natives, using a dataset that links respondents of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) to their longitudinal earnings obtained from individual tax records.

We then consider differences across birth cohorts in the genetic influence on BMI, and cohort variations in the moderating effects of life-course SES on the genetic influence. Our analyses suggest that persistently low SES over the life course or downward mobility (e.g., high SES in childhood but low SES in adulthood) amplify the genetic influence on BMI, and persistently high SES or upward mobility (e.g., low SES in childhood but high SES in adulthood) compensate for such influence. For more recent birth cohorts, the genetic influence on BMI becomes stronger, but the moderating effects of lifetime SES on the genetic influence are weaker compared to earlier cohorts.

Decomposing Segregation within and between Metropolitan Cities and Suburbs","Abstract":"This article documents a new macro-segregation, where the locus of racial differentiation resides increasingly in socio-spatial processes at the community or place level. The goal is to broaden the spatial lens for studying segregation, using decennial Census data on 222 metropolitan areas. Unlike previous neighborhood studies of racial change, we decompose metropolitan segregation into its within- and between-place components from 1990 to 2010. This is accomplished with the Theil index (H). Our decomposition of H reveals large post-1990 declines in metropolitan segregation. But, significantly, macro-segregation\u2014the between-place component\u2014has increased since 1990, offsetting declines in the within-place component. The macro component of segregation is also most pronounced and increasing most rapidly among blacks, accounting for roughly one-half of all metro segregation in the most segregated metropolitan areas of the United States. Macro-segregation is least evident among Asians, which suggests other members of these communities (i.e., middle-class or affluent ethnoburbs) have less resistance to Asians relocating there. These results on emerging patterns of macro-segregation are confirmed in fixed-effects models that control for unobserved heterogeneity across metropolitan areas. Unlike most previous studies focused on the uneven distribution of racial and ethnic groups across metropolitan neighborhoods, we show that racial residential segregation is increasingly shaped by the cities and suburban communities in which neighborhoods are embedded.","DOI":"10.1177\/0003122415588558"},{"Year":2018,"Source title":"American Sociological Review","Title":"Risky Investments: How Local and Foreign Investors Finesse Corruption-Rife Emerging Markets","Abstract":"How do investors enter and navigate markets where there is a general lack of access to information and where the law is open to interpretation?

Many earlier studies have found such a \u201cmale marital wage premium.\u201d Recent studies using panel data for the United States conclude that part of this premium is due to selection of high earners into marriage. Nevertheless, a substantial effect of marriage seems to remain. The current study investigates whether the remaining premium is really a causal effect. Using conventional fixed-effects models, previous studies statistically controlled for selection based on wage levels only. We suggest a more general fixed-effects model that allows for higher wage growth of to-be-married men. The empirical test draws on panel data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (1979 to 2012). We replicate the main finding of the literature: a wage premium remains after controlling for selection on individual wage levels. However, the remaining effect is not causal. The results show that married men earn more because selection into marriage operates not only on wage levels but also on wage growth. Hence, men on a steep career track are especially likely to marry.

Using CPS data from 1979 to 2009, we show that convergence in the gender gap in hourly pay over these three decades was attenuated by the increasing prevalence of \"overwork\" (defined as working 50 or more hours per week) and the rising hourly wage returns to overwork. Because a greater proportion of men engage in overwork, these changes raised men's wages relative to women's and exacerbated the gender wage gap by an estimated 10 percent of the total wage gap. This overwork effect was sufficiently large to offset the wage-equalizing effects of the narrowing gender gap in educational attainment and other forms of human capital. The overwork effect on trends in the gender gap in wages was most pronounced in professional and managerial occupations, where long work hours are especially common and the norm of overwork is deeply embedded in organizational practices and occupational cultures.

Reassessing the \u201cMeritocratic Power\u201d of a College Degree in Intergenerational Income Mobility","Abstract":"Intergenerational mobility is higher among college graduates than among people with lower levels of education. In light of this finding, researchers have characterized a college degree as a great equalizer leveling the playing field, and proposed that expanding higher education would promote mobility. This line of reasoning rests on the implicit assumption that the relatively high mobility observed among college graduates reflects a causal effect of college completion on intergenerational mobility, an assumption that has rarely been rigorously evaluated. This article bridges this gap. Using a novel reweighting technique, I estimate the degree of intergenerational income mobility among college graduates purged of selection processes that may drive up observed mobility in this subpopulation. Analyzing data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979, I find that once selection processes are adjusted for, intergenerational income mobility among college graduates is very close to that among non-graduates. This finding suggests that expanding the pool of college graduates per se is unlikely to boost intergenerational income mobility in the United States. To promote mobility, public investments in higher education (e.g., federal and state student aid programs) should be targeted at low-income youth.","DOI":"10.1177\/0003122419844992"},{"Year":2018,"Source title":"American Sociological Review","Title":"Relative Education and the Advantage of a College Degree","Abstract":"What is the worth of a college degree when higher education expands? The relative education hypothesis posits that when college degrees are rare, individuals with more education have less competition to enter highly-skilled occupations. When college degrees are more common, there may not be enough highly-skilled jobs to go around; some college-educated workers lose out to others and are pushed into less-skilled jobs. Using new measurements of occupation-level verbal, quantitative, and analytic skills, this study tests the changing effect of education on skill utilization across 70 years of birth cohorts from 1971 to 2010, net of all other age, period, and cohort trends. Higher-education expansion erodes the value of a college degree, and college-educated workers are at greater risk for underemployment in less cognitively demanding occupations. This raises questions about the sources of rising income inequality, skill utilization across the working life course, occupational sex segregation, and how returns to education have changed across different life domains.","DOI":"10.1177\/0003122418785371"},{"Year":2019,"Source title":"American Sociological Review","Title":"Brilliant or Bad: The Gendered Social Construction of Exceptionalism in Early Adolescence","Abstract":"From kindergarten through college, students perceive boys as more intelligent than girls, yet few sociological studies have identified how school processes shape students\u2019 gender status beliefs.

In higher-level courses\u2014where affluent, White, and Asian American students were overrepresented\u2014educators tolerated 6th-grade boys\u2019 rule-breaking, such that boys challenged girls\u2019 opinions and monopolized classroom conversations.

Although salient, incarceration is only one form of criminal justice contact and, accordingly, focusing on incarceration may mask the extent to which the criminal justice system influences mental health. Using insights from the stress process paradigm, along with nationally representative data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997, we examine criminal justice contact\u2014defined as arrest, conviction, and incarceration\u2014and mental health. First, fixed-effects models, which adjust for stable unobserved and time-varying observed characteristics, show that arrest is deleteriously associated with mental health, and arrest accounts for nearly half of the association between incarceration and poor mental health, although certain types of incarceration appear more consequential than others. Second, the associations are similar across race and ethnicity; this, combined with racial\/ethnic disparities in contact, indicates that criminal justice interactions exacerbate minority health inequalities. Third, the associations between criminal justice contact, especially arrest and incarceration, and mental health are particularly large among respondents residing in contextually disadvantaged areas during adolescence. Taken together, the results suggest that the consequences of criminal justice contact for mental health have a far greater reach than previously considered.","DOI":"10.1177\/0003122417713188"},{"Year":2016,"Source title":"American Sociological Review","Title":"Money, Work, and Marital Stability: Assessing Change in the Gendered Determinants of Divorce","Abstract":"Despite a large literature investigating how spouses\u2019 earnings and division of labor relate to their risk of divorce, findings remain mixed and conclusions elusive.

When all three conditions obtain, winning a prize is valuable, but seeking it is costly, so trying and failing yields the worst outcome-a logic we characterize as a Tullock lottery. We test the model with analyses of Oscar nominations and Hollywood films from 1985 through 2009. We create an innovative measure of prize-seeking, or \"Oscar appeal,\" on the basis of similarity to recent nominees in terms of such things as genre, plot keywords, and release date. We then show that Oscar appeal has no effect on profitability. However, this zero-order relationship conceals that returns to strong Oscar appeals are bimodal, with super-normal returns for nominees and large losses for snubs. We then argue that the effect of judgment devices on fields depends on how they structure and refract information.","DOI":"10.1177\/0003122413516342"},{"Year":2018,"Source title":"American Sociological Review","Title":"The Paradox of Persistence: Explaining the Black-White Gap in Bachelor\u2019s Degree Completion","Abstract":"Bachelor\u2019s degree (BA) completion is lower among black students than among white students.

Cohesion and focus enhance the legitimacy of a movement and impede member organizations from adopting claims associated with other movements.

Chief executive officers (CEOs), in particular, have seen their compensation increase faster than the growth in firm size. We propose that changes in the macro patterns of the distribution of CEO compensation resulted from a process of diffusion within localized networks, propagating higher pay among corporate executives. We compare three possible explanations for diffusion: director board interlocks, peer groups, and educational networks. The statistical results indicate that corporate director networks facilitate social comparisons that generate the observed pay patterns. Peer and education network effects do not survive a novel endogeneity test that we execute. A key implication is that local diffusion through executive network structures partially explains the changes in macro patterns of income distribution found in the inequality data.","DOI":"10.1177\/0003122415572463"},{"Year":2015,"Source title":"American Sociological Review","Title":"A Paper Ceiling: Explaining the Persistent Underrepresentation of Women in Printed News","Abstract":"In the early twenty-first century, women continue to receive substantially less media coverage than men, despite women\u2019s much increased participation in public life.

But organizations also comprise a primary context where people form social ties. We investigate how the network structure an organization creates among its members influences its ability to grow and reproduce. In particular, we propose that two dimensions of organizational strategy influence affiliation dynamics: (1) the extent to which an organization induces social interaction among its members (social encapsulation), and (2) the time and energy that an organization demands of its members (time and energy demand). We examine membership dynamics in an ecology where competitor organizations deploying varied strategies vie for the same pool of members. Results show a curvilinear relationship between membership growth and the rate of social encapsulation. Furthermore, we find that time and energy demand mediates the effect of social encapsulation by shaping its members\u2019 opportunities for maintaining external affiliations. Different opportunity structures result in different levels of network turnover, thus either reinforcing or dissolving intra-organizational ties.

Recent qualitative research suggests the rise in surveillance may be met with a concomitant increase in efforts to evade it. To date, however, there has been no quantitative empirical test of this theory. In this article, I introduce the concept of \"system avoidance,\" whereby individuals who have had contact with the criminal justice system avoid surveilling institutions that keep formal records. Using data from Add Health (n = 15,170) and the NLSY97 (n = 8,894), I find that individuals who have been stopped by police, arrested, convicted, or incarcerated are less likely to interact with surveilling institutions, including medical, financial, labor market, and educational institutions, than their counterparts who have not had criminal justice contact. By contrast, individuals with criminal justice contact are no less likely to participate in civic or religious institutions. Because criminal justice contact is disproportionately distributed, this study suggests system avoidance is a potential mechanism through which the criminal justice system contributes to social stratification: it severs an already marginalized subpopulation from institutions that are pivotal to desistance from crime and their own integration into broader society.","DOI":"10.1177\/0003122414530398"},{"Year":2017,"Source title":"American Sociological Review","Title":"Own Gender, Sibling\u2019s Gender, Parent\u2019s Gender: The Division of Elderly Parent Care among Adult Children","Abstract":"Research on the gender division of family labor largely focuses on housework and childcare in spousal couples.

In this article, we use unique survey data to test fundamental ideas about intergenerational ties: the role of biology, partnerships (marriage and cohabitation), residence, and selection. The survey used a register-based oversample of Dutch adults who grew up in nonstandard families, collected data among adult children and their parent figures, and used a double multi-actor design in which adult children reported on their parents and parents reported on their children. Using random- and fixed-effects models, we confirm most hypotheses but the results are highly gendered. For fathers, we find evidence for a partnership premium and no disadvantage of being a stepparent once the length of residence is adjusted. For mothers, the partnership premium is weaker but the effect of biology is strong: stepmother-stepchild ties are much weaker, even after taking residence patterns into account. Biological mothers are the primary kinkeepers, and for fathers of any type, their relationship to children depends on their partnership to the biological mother.

Key to these findings is that if the urban poor happen to be wards of the criminal justice system, they receive rushed health care resources, but if they enter health care organizations on their own accord they are policed, delayed, and deterred from accessing care.","DOI":"10.1177\/0003122414549552"},{"Year":2019,"Source title":"American Sociological Review","Title":"Performative State-Formation in the Early American Republic","Abstract":"How do proto-state organizations achieve an initial accumulation of power, such that they are in a position to grow (or shrink) as an organization, maintain their prestige (or lose it), and be viewed, by elite and populace, as something real and consequential that can be argued about, supported, or attacked?

Nor have prior analyses fully investigated how the prevalence of beauty-status exchange varies between different types of couples. I use data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health Romantic Pair Sample, a large (N = 1,507), nationally representative probability sample of dating, cohabiting, and married couples, to investigate how often romantic partners exchange physical attractiveness and socioeconomic status, net of matching on these traits. I find that controlling for matching eliminates nearly all evidence of beauty-status exchange.

Our investigation takes place in the U.S. Senate\u2014a setting in which actors forge political identities for public consumption based on the external constraints, normative obligations, and reputational concerns they face. We argue that interaction between senators who share the same political identity will promote convergence in their voting behavior, whereas interaction between actors with opposing political identities will lead to divergence. Moreover, we theorize that the consequences of political identity for interpersonal influence depend on the local interaction context.

This article presents the first causal evidence of the impact of aggressive policing on minority youths\u2019 educational performance. Under Operation Impact, the New York Police Department (NYPD) saturated high-crime areas with additional police officers with the mission to engage in aggressive, order-maintenance policing. To estimate the effect of this policing program, we use administrative data from more than 250,000 adolescents age 9 to 15 and a difference-in-differences approach based on variation in the timing of police surges across neighborhoods. We find that exposure to police surges significantly reduced test scores for African American boys, consistent with their greater exposure to policing. The size of the effect increases with age, but there is no discernible effect for African American girls and Hispanic students. Aggressive policing can thus lower educational performance for some minority groups. These findings provide evidence that the consequences of policing extend into key domains of social life, with implications for the educational trajectories of minority youth and social inequality more broadly.","DOI":"10.1177\/0003122419826020"},{"Year":2016,"Source title":"American Sociological Review","Title":"Money Supply, Class Power, and Inflation: Monetarism Reassessed","Abstract":"Recent sociological work shows that pro-market neoliberal policies across advanced capitalist countries are due to distributional struggle between classes in the 1970s and 1980s. The orthodox monetarist view, alternatively, sees neoliberal reform as a nonpolitical attempt to end the stagflation crisis of the 1970s. From this perspective, monetary and fiscal expansions brought high inflation, and central bank discipline and government austerity is the solution; but the recent trend of low inflation despite accelerating money growth and government spending contradicts this view. Analyses of time-series cross-section data for 23 OECD countries from 1960 to 2009 support the thesis that the rise and fall of inflation is more about distribution of power between labor and capital than about monetary and fiscal discipline. Inflation in the 1970s originated from a strong working class and hurt capital more than it did workers, while neoliberal repression of workers\u2019 power has kept inflation low from the 1980s onward. Disempowerment of labor created rising inequality and economic imbalances that fueled a financial boom underlying the global financial crisis of 2008.

As a micro motive for behavior, status is as significant as money and power. At a macro level, status stabilizes resource and power inequality by transforming it into cultural status beliefs about group differences regarding who is \"better\" (esteemed and competent). But cultural status beliefs about which groups are \"better\" constitute group differences as independent dimensions of inequality that generate material advantages due to group membership itself. Acting through micro-level social relations in workplaces, schools, and elsewhere, status beliefs bias evaluations of competence and suitability for authority, bias associational preferences, and evoke resistance to status challenges from low-status group members. These effects accumulate to direct members of higher status groups toward positions of resources and power while holding back lower status group members. Through these processes, status writes group differences such as gender, race, and class-based life style into organizational structures of resources and power, creating durable inequality. Status is thus a central mechanism behind durable patterns of inequality based on social differences.","DOI":"10.1177\/0003122413515997"},{"Year":2014,"Source title":"American Sociological Review","Title":"Entrepreneurship as a Mobility Process","Abstract":"We advance a theory of how organizational characteristics, in particular the structure of opportunity within organizations, shape the decision to become an entrepreneur.

Prior studies identify two sets of reactions: (1) White people identify more strongly with ingroup members, and (2) they withhold material and symbolic resources from outgroup members. This study explores another possibility: White people may alter the boundary around Whiteness by redefining the criteria for membership.

We explore mechanisms that may drive the relationship between rising income inequality and widening class gaps in parental financial investments in children.

In 2005, approximately one sixth of all mortgage-financed home purchases in the United States were for investment purposes. This article develops a sociological account that links the geographic distribution of popular investment to the social and institutional organization of communities. Regression analyses of 1,566 municipalities from 2000 to 2006 indicate that non-occupant investment (but not conventional owner-occupant investment) occurred at significantly greater rates in places where local development institutions were organized in accordance with laissez-faire principles to a greater degree, where economic activities in other domains were less locally embedded in place, and where greater residential instability produced more tenuous connections between residents and places. The magnitudes of these associations suggest that social organization and cultural-institutional conditions were at least as informative as variations in housing price appreciation in shaping the incidence of investor activity during the bubble. Social organization also moderated the behavioral effects of price appreciation. The article advances research on locally-embedded bases of economic action by examining how community environments provide more or less fertile ground for mass-participatory housing speculation and instrumental orientations toward places as exchange-values.","DOI":"10.1177\/0003122418808212"},{"Year":2016,"Source title":"American Sociological Review","Title":"Tactical Innovation in Social Movements: The Effects of Peripheral and Multi-Issue Protest","Abstract":"Social movement researchers argue that tactical innovation occurs as a response to changes external to movements, such as police repression and shifts in political authority, or is due to internal movement processes, such as the characteristics of movement organizations and actors.

In this article, I investigate the link between credentials, skills, and labor market outcomes against a background of societal-level educational expansion and skills diffusion. Using internationally comparable OECD data for approximately 30,000 individuals in 26 countries, I find that both credentials and skills generally contribute to occupational and monetary rewards.

Nevertheless, returns to credentials decline in tandem with educational expansion, whereas skills retain their premium even as they diffuse in a given society. Furthermore, skills diffusion also leads to the diminishing monetary return to high credentials. These findings suggest that skills diffusion promotes more meritocratic reward allocation via devaluing high credentials without explicit depreciation of high skills.","DOI":"10.1177\/0003122419897873"},{"Year":2016,"Source title":"American Sociological Review","Title":"The Great and the Small: The Impact of Collective Action on the Evolution of Board Interlocks after the Panic of 1907","Abstract":"Conventional research in organizational theory highlights the role of board interlocks in facilitating business collective action.

To do this, we leverage the case of medical residency so that we can examine how changes in role expectations shape assessment while holding occupation and organization constant. By analyzing a dataset of 2,765 performance evaluations from a three-year emergency medicine training program, we empirically demonstrate that women and men are reviewed as equally capable at the beginning of residency, when the student role dominates; however, in year three, when the colleague role dominates, men are perceived as outperforming women. Furthermore, when we hold resident performance somewhat constant by comparing feedback to medical errors of similar severity, we find that in the third year of residency, but not the first, women receive more harsh criticism and less supportive feedback than men. Ultimately, this study suggests that role expectations, and the implicit biases they can trigger, matter significantly to the production of gender inequality, even when holding organization, occupation, and resident performance constant.","DOI":"10.1177\/0003122420907066"},{"Year":2015,"Source title":"American Sociological Review","Title":"Paradoxes of Social Policy: Welfare Transfers, Relative Poverty, and Redistribution Preferences","Abstract":"Korpi and Palme\u2019s (1998) classic \u201cThe Paradox of Redistribution and Strategies of Equality\u201d claims that universal social policy better reduces poverty than social policies targeted at the poor.

The traditional perspective (43 percent) is marked by a preference for religion compared to science; the modern perspective (36 percent) holds the opposite view. A third perspective, which we call post-secular (21 percent), views both science and religion favorably. However, when faced with competing accounts of events such as creation and evolution, post-seculars root their views in religion rather than in mainstream science. Regression models indicate that perspectives on science and religion do not simply mirror other denominational or ideological differences. Furthermore, religio-scientific perspectives shape attitudes about political issues where scientific and some religious communities diverge, including on abortion rights and stem cell research. Overall, most individuals favor either scientific or religious ways of understanding, but many scientifically inclined individuals prefer certain religious accounts. This suggests that public divisions related to science and religion are cultural and epistemological. This article underscores the complexity of the boundary between reason and faith and highlights the roots of political conflict in perspectives on science and religion in the United States.","DOI":"10.1177\/0003122414558919"},{"Year":2018,"Source title":"American Sociological Review","Title":"The Structure of Deference: Modeling Occupational Status Using Affect Control Theory","Abstract":"Current theories of occupational status conceptualize it as either a function of cultural esteem or the symbolic aspect of the class structure. Based on Weber\u2019s definition of status as rooted in either cultural or class conditions, we argue that a consistent operationalization of occupational status must account for both of these dimensions. Using quantitative measures of cultural sentiments for occupational identities, we use affect control theory to model the network deference relations across occupations. We calculate a measure of the extent to which one occupational actor deferring to another is incongruent with cultural expectations for all possible combinations of 304 occupational titles. Because high-status actors are less likely to defer to low-status actors, the degree to which these events violate cultural expectations provides an indicator of the relative status position of different occupations. We assess the construct validity of our new deference score measure using Harris Poll data. Deference scores are more predictive of status rankings from poll data than are occupational prestige scores. We establish criterion validity using five theoretically relevant workplace outcomes: subjective work attachment, job satisfaction, general happiness, the importance of meaningful work, and perceived respect at work.","DOI":"10.1177\/0003122418761857"},{"Year":2018,"Source title":"American Sociological Review","Title":"The Dynamics of Intimate Partner Violence and the Risk of Pregnancy during the Transition to Adulthood","Abstract":"Using a reproductive coercion framework, we investigate the role of intimate partner violence (IPV) in pregnancy during the transition to adulthood. We use two types of data from a population-based sample of 867 young women in a Michigan county: a 60-minute survey interview with 2.5 years of weekly follow-up surveys, and semi-structured interviews with a subsample of 40 pregnant women. The semi-structured interviews illustrate the violence women experienced. Discrete-time logit hazard models demonstrate that threats and physical assault are associated with higher pregnancy rates during ages 18 to 22. However, this holds only when the violence is recent; violence occurring more than a month earlier is not associated with higher pregnancy rates. These associations are independent of violent experiences with prior partners, which are also associated with higher pregnancy rates. Fixed-effects models show that during violent weeks, women perceive more pregnancy desire from their partners, have more sex, and use less contraception than during nonviolent weeks. Finally, mediation analyses and the semi-structured interviews are consistent with reproductive coercion: violent young men are more likely to want their girlfriends pregnant, and they use threats and physical assault to implement their preferences via sex and contraceptive non-use, which in turn increase pregnancy rates.","DOI":"10.1177\/0003122418795856"},{"Year":2020,"Source title":"American Sociological Review","Title":"Becoming Wards of the State: Race, Crime, and Childhood in the Struggle for Foster Care Integration, 1920s to 1960s","Abstract":"Using archival materials from the Domestic Relations Court of New York City, this article traces the conflict between private institutions and the state over responsibility for neglected African American children in the early twentieth century. After a long history of exclusion by private child welfare, the court assumed public responsibility for the protection of children of all races. Yet, in an arrangement of delegated governance, judges found themselves unable to place non-white children because of the enduring exclusionary policies of private agencies. When the situation became critical, the City sought to wrest control from private agencies by developing a supplemental public foster care system. This compromise over responsibility racialized the developing public foster care system of New York City, and it transformed frameworks of child protection as a social problem. The findings highlight the political salience surrounding issues of racial access in the delegated welfare state. Tracing how the conflict over access unfolded in New York City child protection provides an empirical case for understanding how the delegation of social welfare to private agencies can actually weaken racial integration efforts, generate distinct modes of social welfare inclusion, and racialize perceptions of social problems.","DOI":"10.1177\/0003122420911062"},{"Year":2014,"Source title":"American Sociological Review","Title":"Does Immigration Undermine Public Support for Social Policy?","Abstract":"There has been great interest in the relationship between immigration and the welfare state in recent years, and particularly since Alesina and Glaeser's (2004) influential work. Following literatures on solidarity and fractionalization, race in the U.S. welfare state, and anti-immigrant sentiments, many contend that immigration undermines public support for social policy. This study analyzes three measures of immigration and six welfare attitudes using 1996 and 2006 International Social Survey Program (ISSP) data for 17 affluent democracies. Based on multi-level and two-way fixed-effects models, our results mostly fail to support the generic hypothesis that immigration undermines public support for social policy. The percent foreign born, net migration, and the 10-year change in the percent foreign born all fail to have robust significant negative effects on welfare attitudes. There is evidence that the percent foreign born significantly undermines the welfare attitude that government \"should provide a job for everyone who wants one.\" However, there is more robust evidence that net migration and change in percent foreign born have positive effects on welfare attitudes. We conclude that the compensation and chauvinism hypotheses provide greater potential for future research, and we critically consider other ways immigration could undermine the welfare state. Ultimately, this study demonstrates that factors other than immigration are far more important for public support of social policy.","DOI":"10.1177\/0003122413513022"},{"Year":2016,"Source title":"American Sociological Review","Title":"Inequality in Children\u2019s Contexts: Income Segregation of Households with and without Children","Abstract":"Past research shows that income segregation between neighborhoods increased over the past several decades.

Second, I find that local school options, delineated by school district boundaries, contribute to higher segregation among households with children compared to households without. Rising income inequality provided high-income households more resources, and parents used these resources to purchase housing in particular neighborhoods, with residential decisions structured, in part, by school district boundaries. Overall, results indicate that children face greater and increasing stratification in neighborhood contexts than do all residents, and this has implications for growing inequalities in their future outcomes.","DOI":"10.1177\/0003122416642430"},{"Year":2017,"Source title":"American Sociological Review","Title":"Ambiguity and Scientific Authority: Population Classification in Genomic Science","Abstract":"The molecularization of race thesis suggests geneticists are gaining greater authority to define human populations and differences, and they are doing so by increasingly defining them in terms of U.S. racial categories.

Geneticists use eight classification systems that follow racial, geographic, and ethnic logics of definition. We find limited support for racialization of classification.

I offer a new conceptual framework for understanding the varied effects of internal conflict on state capacity, as measured through taxation. Contrary to the general scholarly consensus that internal wars make states fail, I hypothesize that like external wars, internal wars can lead to increased taxation when they enhance solidarity toward the state among the elite and motivate the state to strengthen and territorially expand the tax administration. Elite solidarity, in turn, depends on the degree to which elites perceive the risks of war as real, decide to protect their interests with the help of the state, and feel a sense of patriotism. However, due to the existence of insurgent actors with taxing capacity, the positive effect of internal wars on state building may be hampered. I use this framework to make sense of the cases of Colombia, Malaysia, and Singapore, where internal wars, despite their otherwise destructive effects, resulted in state building instead of state failure.","DOI":"10.1177\/0003122415615903"},{"Year":2017,"Source title":"American Sociological Review","Title":"Channeling Hearts and Minds: Advocacy Organizations, Cognitive-Emotional Currents, and Public Conversation","Abstract":"Do advocacy organizations stimulate public conversation about social problems by engaging in rational debate, or by appealing to emotions?

We consider inequality in terms of between-class differences in three areas\u2014education, wages, and income\u2014and in a composite measure. Building on sociological mobility theory, we argue that cross-country variation in mobility results, in part, from families adapting to different levels of between-class inequality. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find a negative correlation between inter-class inequality and social fluidity, with between-class inequality being a better predictor of mobility chances than conventional distributional measures. We also find that the resource distance between classes is negatively related to the strength of their intergenerational association for some off-diagonal origin and destination (OD) class combinations.","DOI":"10.1177\/0003122419885094"},{"Year":2016,"Source title":"American Sociological Review","Title":"Immigration and Welfare Support in Germany","Abstract":"In recent years, several international-comparative studies have analyzed the relationship between migration and native populations\u2019 decreasing support for redistributive policies.

Using a large hierarchical and longitudinal dataset consisting of student and school records, we examine the effect of suspension on reading and math achievement. Our findings suggest that higher levels of exclusionary discipline within schools over time generate collateral damage, negatively affecting the academic achievement of non-suspended students in punitive contexts. This effect is strongest in schools with high levels of exclusionary discipline and schools with low levels of violence, although the adverse effect of exclusionary discipline is evident in even the most disorganized and hostile school environments.

Prevailing understandings focus on constraints to residential choice, but even under limitations, families make active residential decisions.

In high-crime neighborhoods, renters stay put as long as they can craft a story that justifies remaining.

Researchers have identified two broad processes governing prosociality in generalized exchange systems: generalized reciprocity (a person who receives help from someone pays it forward by helping a third person) and indirect reciprocity (a person who helps another establishes a prosocial reputation and, as a consequence, later receives help from a third person). Although generalized exchange systems can be based on either process, generalized and indirect reciprocity are based on different mechanisms and, with few exceptions, have been investigated independently.

Most instances of possible joke theft are ambiguous owing to the potential for simultaneous and coincidental discovery. I find that accusations are not strongly coupled to jokes\u2019 similarity, and enforcement depends mainly on the extent to which insiders view the comic in question as being authentic to the community. Comics who are oriented toward external rewards, have a track record of anti-social behavior, and exhibit lackluster on-stage craft are vulnerable to joke theft accusations even in borderline cases because those inauthentic characteristics are typical of transgressors. Vulnerability is greatest for comics who enjoy commercial success despite low peer esteem. Authenticity protects comics because it reflects community-based status, which yields halo effects while encouraging relationships predicated on respect.

As the nation has become more diverse, cross-category contacts in race\/ethnicity and religion have increased. After describing the raw homophily rates, we develop a case-control model to assess homophily relative to chance mixing. We find decreasing rates of homophily for gender but stability for race and age, although the young are increasingly isolated from older cohorts outside of the family. We also find some weak evidence for increasing educational and religious homophily. These relational trends may be explained by changes in demographic heterogeneity, institutional segregation, economic inequality, and symbolic boundaries.","DOI":"10.1177\/0003122414531776"},{"Year":2015,"Source title":"American Sociological Review","Title":"After State Socialism: The Political Origins of Transitional Recessions","Abstract":"Transitions from state socialism created a startling range of initial economic outcomes, from renewed growth to deep economic crises. Debates about the causes have largely ignored the political disruptions due to regime change that coincided with sudden initial recessions, and they have defined the problem as relative growth rates over time rather than abrupt short-run collapse. Political disruptions were severe when states broke apart into newly independent units, leading to hyperinflation, armed warfare, or both. Even absent these disruptions, the disintegration of communist parties inherently undermined economic activity by creating uncertainty about the ownership of state assets. The protracted deterioration of the party-state prior to the breakup of the Soviet Union generated widespread conflict over control of assets, which crippled economic activity across the Soviet successor states. A more rapid path to regime change was less disruptive in other post-communist states, and the problem was absent in surviving communist regimes. Comparative accounts of regime change frame an analysis of panel data from 31 countries after 1989 that distinguishes the early 1990s from subsequent years. A wide range of variables associated with alternative explanations have little evident impact in accounting for the onset and severity of the early 1990s recessions.","DOI":"10.1177\/0003122414568649"},{"Year":2014,"Source title":"American Sociological Review","Title":"Shaming the corporation: The social production of targets and the anti-sweatshop movement","Abstract":"As social movements co-evolve with changes in states and markets, it is crucial to examine how they make particular kinds of actors into focal points for the expression of grievances and the demand for rights. But researchers often bracket the question of why some kinds of organizations are more likely than others to become targets of social movement pressure. We theorize the \u201csocial production of targets\u201d by social movements, rejecting a simple \u201creflection\u201d model to focus on configurations of power and vulnerability that shape repertoires of contention. Empirically, we extend structural accounts of global commodity chains and cultural accounts of markets to analyze the production of targets in the case of the anti-sweatshop movement of the 1990s. Using a longitudinal, firm-level dataset and unique data on anti-sweatshop activism, we identify factors that attracted social movement pressure to particular companies. Firms\u2019 power and positions strongly shaped their likelihood of becoming targets of anti-sweatshop activism. But the likelihood of being a target also depended on the cultural organization of markets, which made some firms more \u201cshamable\u201d than others.

Evidence on the Gender Pay Gap from Multifactorial Survey Experiments","Abstract":"Gender pay gaps likely persist in Western societies because both men and women consider somewhat lower earnings for female employees than for otherwise similar male employees to be fair. Two different theoretical approaches explain \u201clegitimate\u201d wage gaps: same-gender referent theory and reward expectations theory. The first approach states that women compare their lower earnings primarily with that of other underpaid women; the second approach argues that both men and women value gender as a status variable that yields lower expectations about how much each gender should be paid for otherwise equal work. This article is the first to analyze hypotheses contrasting the two theories using an experimental factorial survey design. In 2009, approximately 1,600 German residents rated more than 26,000 descriptions of fictitious employees. The labor market characteristics of each employee and the amount of information given about them were experimentally varied across all descriptions. The results primarily support reward expectations theory. Both men and women produced gender pay gaps in their fairness ratings (with the mean ratio of just female-to-male wages being.92). Respondents framed the just pay ratios by the gender inequalities they experienced in their own occupations, and some evidence of gender-specific evaluation standards emerged.","DOI":"10.1177\/0003122416683393"},{"Year":2015,"Source title":"American Sociological Review","Title":"The Price of Protection: A Trajectory Analysis of Civil Remedies for Abuse and Women\u2019s Earnings","Abstract":"We know men\u2019s violence against women is costly.

This study investigates the temporal dynamics of women\u2019s earnings and petitioning for a Protection from Abuse (PFA) civil restraining order. Women\u2019s earnings might rise or fall at the time of petitioning but quickly return to pre-petitioning levels, a short-term boost or shock; or, petitioning might precipitate a longer-term stall or upward shift in women\u2019s earnings. To test for these effects, we use latent growth curve analysis and evaluate women\u2019s earnings trajectories over six years. We find overwhelming evidence that the period around petitioning is one of exceptional earnings instability for petitioners, many of whom experience both shocks and stalls. Virtually no one experiences a boost in the quarter of petitioning or an upward shift in earnings growth in the year after petitioning for a PFA. Welfare, however, buffers negative effects of petitioning on women\u2019s earnings growth. We also calculate lost earnings as the difference between women\u2019s counterfactual projected and estimated earnings.

How do the same micro-mechanisms generate significant variation in global network structures? To answer this question we propose and test a network ecological theory that specifies the ways features of organizational environments moderate the expression of tie-formation processes, thereby generating variability in global network structures across settings.

These results suggest that normative and institutional constraints may force people to retain difficult and demanding alters in their networks. We also found that providing support to alters, but not receiving support from those alters, was a major source of difficulty in these relationships. Furthermore, the felt burden of providing support was not attenuated by receiving assistance, suggesting that alters involved in reciprocated exchanges were not less often labeled difficult than were those in unreciprocated ones.

We create a monthly panel by merging all births in Mexico from 2008 to 2010 with homicide data at the municipality level. Findings from fixed-effects models indicate that exposure to homicides in the first trimester of gestation increases infant birth weight and reduces the proportion of low birth weight. The effect is not driven by fertility or migration responses to environmental violence. The mechanism driving this surprising positive effect appears to be an increase in mothers\u2019 health-enhancing behaviors (particularly the use of prenatal care) as a result of exposure to violence. The positive effect of homicide exposure is heterogeneous across socioeconomic status (SES). It is strong among low-SES women\u2014but only those living in urban areas\u2014and null among the most advantaged women. This variation suggests that behavioral responses to an increase in local homicides depend on a combination of increased vulnerability and access to basic resources that allow women to obtain prenatal care.","DOI":"10.1177\/0003122414544733"},{"Year":2014,"Source title":"American Sociological Review","Title":"Black Mexicans, Conjunctural Ethnicity, and Operating Identities: Long-Term Ethnographic Analysis","Abstract":"This article draws on more than 15 years of research to analyze \"Black Mexicans,\" phenotypically \"Mexican-looking\" youth who identified as Black during adolescence, used this identity to become upwardly mobile, and then abandoned it in early adulthood.

Most such theory posits that assimilation into Black, inner-city culture leads to downward mobility. To explain how and why this did not happen for Black Mexicans, I propose a sensitizing framework using the concepts of conjunctural ethnicity, emphasizing analysis of racial and ethnic identity in local, historical, and life course contexts; and operating identity, which analyzes identities in interactions and can accommodate slippage in informants' understanding or use of ethnic and racial categories. Some Mexicans used a Black culture of mobility to become upwardly mobile in the late-1990s and early-2000s in New York, adopting a socially advantaged operating identity that helped them in ways they felt Mexicanness could not in that historical conjuncture, especially given intra-ethnic competition between teen migrants and second-generation youth.

In this article, we propose that the social environment can also transform the genetic link between two traits. Taking the relationship between educational attainment and smoking as an exemplary case, we use genome-wide methods to examine whether genetic variants linked to education are also linked to smoking, and whether the strength of this relationship varies across birth cohorts. Results suggest that the genetic relationship between education and smoking is stronger among U.S. adults born between 1974 and 1983 than among those born between 1920 and 1959. These results are supported by replication in additional data from the United Kingdom. Environmental conditions that differ across birth cohorts may result in the bundling of genetic effects on multiple outcomes, as anticipated by classic cohort theory.

Yet, ratings systems may also indirectly influence organizations when the collective presence of more rated peers alters the broader institutional and competitive milieu. Rated firms may be more responsive to ratings systems when surrounded by more rated peers, and ratings may generate diffuse or spillover effects even among unrated firms. We test these arguments by analyzing how rated and unrated firms change their pollution behavior when more firms in their peer group are rated on environmental performance. Results indicate that the presence of more rated peers is often associated with emissions reductions. This relationship varies, however, by whether a firm was rated, whether the rating was positive or negative (if rated), and, often, features of the competitive and regulatory environment.","DOI":"10.1177\/0003122414559043"},{"Year":2017,"Source title":"American Sociological Review","Title":"Support for Beauty-Status Exchange Remains Illusory","Abstract":"In my article, \u201cBeauty and Status: The Illusion of Exchange in Partner Selection?\u201d (McClintock 2014), I used descriptive statistics, three forms of regression, and six measures of socioeconomic status to examine the \u201ctrophy wife\u201d stereotype that women \u201cexchange\u201d their beauty for men\u2019s status. According to the stereotype, such women would partner with comparatively less-attractive men who are comparatively high in socioeconomic status.

Gullickson critiques my analysis on two grounds, arguing against the difference-based regression models, and proposing a new specification of interaction effects in the log-linear models. However, the difference models conceptualize exchange as defined in the relevant literature, and Gullickson\u2019s modified difference models only replicate my conventional regression models, providing no new evidence for or against beauty-status exchange. Likewise, Gullickson\u2019s proposed log-linear specifications are not only non-hierarchical, they also fail to improve model fit or to support exchange when using alternative measures of status.

Second, women\u2019s relationship structure preferences are more responsive than men\u2019s to the removal of institutional constraints through supportive work-family policy interventions.

Nor do they typically examine how such factors might, in turn, affect housing conditions for city dwellers. Over the past two decades, the advent and diffusion of the limited liability company (LLC) has reshaped the legal landscape of rental ownership. Increasingly, rental properties are owned by business organizations that limit investor liability, rather than by individual landlords who own property in their own names. An analysis of administrative records and survey data from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, demonstrates that signs of housing disinvestment increase when properties transition from individual to LLC ownership. This increase is not explained by selection on property characteristics or by divergent pre-transfer trends. Results affirm that real estate investors are responsive to changes in the legal environment and that the protective structure of the LLC facilitates housing disinvestment in Milwaukee. Elaborating the role of real estate investors can deepen accounts of neighborhood change processes and help explain variation in local housing conditions. Ultimately, public policies that enable business operators to circumscribe or reallocate risk may generate unintended costs for consumers and the public.","DOI":"10.1177\/0003122418821339"},{"Year":2015,"Source title":"American Sociological Review","Title":"The Power of Transparency: Evidence from a British Workplace Survey","Abstract":"Does the dissemination of organizational financial information shift power dynamics within workplaces, as evidenced by increasing workers\u2019 wages?

The study uses 44 years of data from the General Social Survey representing opinions and attitudes across a wide array of domains as elements in an evolving belief network. Analyses of this network produce evidence that mass polarization has increased via a process of belief consolidation, entailing the collapse of previously cross-cutting alignments, thus creating increasingly broad and encompassing clusters organized around cohesive packages of beliefs. Further, the increasing salience of political ideology and partisanship only partly explains this trend.

Respondents \u201cde-gender\u201d their allocation process, or decouple it from gender ideology and gendered social forces, by narrowing their temporal horizon to the present moment and deploying an adaptable understanding of constraint that obscures alternative paths. This de-gendering helps prevent spousal conflict, but it may also facilitate behavioral stasis by directing attention away from the inequalities that continue to shape domestic life.","DOI":"10.1177\/0003122420950208"},{"Year":2014,"Source title":"American Sociological Review","Title":"House of Green Cards: Statistical or Preference-Based Inequality in the Employment of Foreign Nationals","Abstract":"This study contributes to the labor market inequality and organizations literature by investigating the role that government agents play in shaping the employment of immigrants.

Recent changes to U.S. healthcare policy prompted by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), however, provide adults with new pathways for accessing a key form of social welfare\u2014health insurance\u2014decoupled from employers, spouses, and children. Taking advantage of this fundamental shift in the country\u2019s system of social welfare provision, I use data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) to explore patterns of health insurance coverage from before and after the ACA became active in 2014. The results show that the salience of labor market, marriage, and family attachments as pathways to coverage significantly declined in the first three years following passage of the ACA. By providing adults with a new route to coverage decoupled from their institutional attachments, the ACA helped narrow health insurance inequalities across gender, race and ethnicity, and education. Given the strong association between health insurance and health outcomes, the results from this study raise important questions about the centrality of institutional attachments for our knowledge of health inequalities.","DOI":"10.1177\/0003122418811112"},{"Year":2017,"Source title":"American Sociological Review","Title":"The Effects of Gendered Occupational Roles on Men\u2019s and Women\u2019s Workplace Authority: Evidence from Microfinance","Abstract":"The gendering of occupational roles affects a variety of outcomes for workers and organizations.

We use data from a microfinance bank in Central America to examine how working initially with a male or female loan manager shapes borrowers\u2019 compliance with future managers\u2019 directives. First, we show that borrowers originally paired with female managers continue to be less compliant with subsequent managers, regardless of subsequent managers\u2019 gender. Next, we demonstrate how compliance is shaped by the gender-typing of the role and the gender of the individual who fills that role. We find that men enjoy significantly greater compliance in male-typed roles, but male and female managers experience similar levels of compliance in female-typed roles. Further analyses reveal that these gendered patterns become especially pronounced after managers demonstrate their authority by disciplining borrowers. Overall, we show how quickly gendered expectations become inscribed into occupational roles, and we identify their lasting organizational consequences. More broadly, we suggest authority mechanisms that may contribute to the \u201cstalled\u201d gender revolution in the workplace.","DOI":"10.1177\/0003122417703087"},{"Year":2018,"Source title":"American Sociological Review","Title":"The Mark of a Woman\u2019s Record: Gender and Academic Performance in Hiring","Abstract":"Women earn better grades than men across levels of education\u2014but to what end?

I conducted an audit study by submitting 2,106 job applications that experimentally manipulated applicants\u2019 GPA, gender, and college major. Although GPA matters little for men, women benefit from moderate achievement but not high achievement. As a result, high-achieving men are called back significantly more often than high-achieving women\u2014at a rate of nearly 2-to-1. I further find that high-achieving women are most readily penalized when they major in math: high-achieving men math majors are called back three times as often as their women counterparts. A survey experiment conducted with 261 hiring decision-makers suggests that these patterns are due to employers\u2019 gendered standards for applicants. Employers value competence and commitment among men applicants, but instead privilege women applicants who are perceived as likeable. This standard helps moderate-achieving women, who are often described as sociable and outgoing, but hurts high-achieving women, whose personalities are viewed with more skepticism. These findings suggest that achievement invokes gendered stereotypes that penalize women for having good grades, creating unequal returns to academic performance at labor market entry.","DOI":"10.1177\/0003122418762291"},{"Year":2016,"Source title":"American Sociological Review","Title":"The Role of Gender, Class, and Religion in Biracial Americans\u2019 Racial Labeling Decisions","Abstract":"Racial attachments are understood to be socially constructed and endogenous to gender, socioeconomic, and religious identities.

In this article, I investigate how social identities shape the racial labels chosen by biracial individuals in the United States, a rapidly growing population who have multiple labeling options. Examining national surveys of more than 37,000 respondents of Latino-white, Asian-white, and black-white parentage, I disentangle how gender, socioeconomic status, and religious identity influence racial labeling decisions. Across biracial subgroups and net of all other influences, economic affluence and Jewish identity predict whiter self-identification, whereas belonging to a religion more commonly associated with racial minorities is associated with a minority identification. Gender, however, is the single best predictor of identification, with biracial women markedly more likely than biracial men to identify as multiracial. These findings help us better understand the contextual nature of racial identification and the processes via which social identities interact with racial meanings in the United States.","DOI":"10.1177\/0003122415623286"},{"Year":2018,"Source title":"American Sociological Review","Title":"Addressing Recognition Gaps: Destigmatization and the Reduction of Inequality","Abstract":"This Presidential Address offers elements for a systematic and cumulative study of destigmatization, or the process by which low-status groups gain recognition and worth.

(2) For the foreign-born, upward mobility became associated with white identity, which allowed those who \"became white\" to be seen as less threatening. We thus expect the threat from foreign-born whites to be highest where their concentration in poverty was greatest. (3) We suggest that violence against a given boundary raises the salience of group threat, so a positive relationship should exist between prior violence against a group and its level of incarceration for misdemeanors.

In contrast, this article explores how the formalization and legalization of downsizing affect inequalities. According to bureaucracy theory and management practitioners, formalization constrains decision-makers' bias, but neo-structural and feminist theories of inequality argue that formalization can itself be gendered and racially biased. Accountability theory advances this debate, pointing to organizational and institutional processes that motivate executives to minimize inequality. Building on these theories, and drawing on unique data from a national sample of 327 downsized establishments between 1971 and 2002, I analyze how layoff formalization and actors' antidiscrimination accountability affect women's and minorities' representation in management after downsizing. Results demonstrate that, first, downsizing significantly reduces managerial diversity. Second, formalization exacerbates these negative effects when layoff rules rely on positions or tenure, but not when layoff rules require an individualized evaluation. Finally, antidiscrimination accountability generated by internal legal counsels or compliance awareness prods executives to override formal rules and reduce inequalities. I conclude that although downsizing has been increasingly managed by formal rules and monitored by legal experts, this has often meant the institutionalization of unequal, rather than equal, opportunity.","DOI":"10.1177\/0003122413518553"},{"Year":2015,"Source title":"American Sociological Review","Title":"Us and Them: Black-White Relations in the Wake of Hispanic Population Growth","Abstract":"How will Hispanic population growth affect black-white relations in the United States?

This study is based on an original experiment that combines behavioral game and survey methods to evaluate the impact of perceived Hispanic growth on attitudes and behavior. Results reveal opposite reactions among blacks and whites. Whites in the baseline condition contribute comparable amounts to black and white recipients in a dictator game, whereas whites who first read about Hispanic growth contribute more to white recipients than to black ones. By contrast, blacks in the baseline condition contribute more to black recipients than to white ones, whereas blacks who first read about Hispanic growth contribute comparable amounts to black and white recipients. Patterns of identification mirror patterns of contributions: whites exposed to Hispanic growth identify relatively more strongly with their racial group than with their national group, whereas blacks exposed to Hispanic growth identify relatively more strongly with their national group than with their racial group. Together, these results suggest that people respond to the growth of a third group by prioritizing the most privileged identity to which they can plausibly lay claim and which also excludes the growing group.","DOI":"10.1177\/0003122415587313"},{"Year":2015,"Source title":"American Sociological Review","Title":"Accounting for the Child in the Transmission of Party Identification","Abstract":"The transmission of party identification from parent to child is one of the most important components of political socialization in the United States. Research shows that children learn their party identification from their parents, and parents drive the learning process. The vast majority of studies thus treats children as passive recipients of information and assumes that parent-child concordance equals transmission. Rather than relying on a single pathway by which parents teach children, we propose an alternative view by focusing on children as active agents in their socialization. In so doing, we introduce a two-step model of transmission: perception then adoption. Utilizing two unique family-based studies that contain self-reported measures of party identification for both parents and children, children\u2019s perceptions of their parents\u2019 party affiliations, and measures of the parent-child relationship, we find children differentially learn and then choose to affiliate, or not, with their parents.

These shifts reveal changes not only in the contents of elite culture but also in the nature of elite distinction, in particular, (1) how the applicability of emulation and (mis)recognition theories has changed over time, and (2) the emergence of a contemporary mode that publicly emphasizes everyday cultural practice (to accentuate ordinariness, authenticity, and cultural connection) while retaining many tastes that continue to be (mis)recognized as legitimate.","DOI":"10.1177\/0003122420912941"},{"Year":2017,"Source title":"American Sociological Review","Title":"A Position with a View: Educational Status and the Construction of the Occupational Hierarchy","Abstract":"The differentiation of occupations is of central concern to stratification scholars studying class and mobility, yet little is known about how individuals actually see the occupational landscape.

Using the 1989 GSS occupational prestige module, we investigate how cognitive maps of the occupational hierarchy vary in terms of content and structure. The results show that maps are more homogeneous among individuals with more versus less education. This increased consensus arises, in part, because better educated respondents are more likely to set aside training-intensive occupations as a relatively elite set of occupations at the top of the hierarchy. In contrast, less educated respondents generate more gradational classification systems that are significantly less sensitive to training intensiveness as a basis for categorical distinction.

Yet how work and family combine to influence stress among young adult women is not well understood. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, we leverage new extensions to latent class analysis (LCA) to identify common combinations of work and family circumstances among young adult women, their earlier life and contemporaneous correlates, and associations with two stress measures: a multi-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Epstein-Barr Viral (EBV) antibody titers, a well-validated biomarker of stress-related immunity impairments. We identify seven different common combinations of latent work-family combinations among young adult women ranging from well-compensated professional workers with and without children, mothers without paid employment, and delayed transitions to work and family. Completing a college degree was associated with a higher likelihood of membership in classes marked by professional work irrespective of motherhood, while being raised in a community with greater female labor opportunities was generally associated with membership in child-free classes. Mothers and child-free women in \"pink-collar\" work with low wages and decision-marking freedom reported higher stress compared to women in \"white-collar\" work with higher wages and decision-making freedom. These differences are mostly attenuated following adjustments for poverty-related stressors and work-family conflict. While prior work has emphasized the health benefits for women of combining work and family, our research suggests these benefits may be limited to women of higher socioeconomic status with flexible, well-compensated jobs.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/soy117"},{"Year":2015,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Individual troubles, shared troubles: The multiplicative effect of individual and country-level unemployment on life satisfaction in 95 nations (1981-2009)","Abstract":"Although the negative association between unemployment and life satisfaction is well documented, much theoretical and empirical controversy surrounds the question of how unemployment actually shapes life satisfaction.

Drawing on data from the World and European Values Surveys, National Accounts Official Country Data, Social Security Programs Throughout the World Reports, World Development Indicators, and World Income Inequality databases for 398,533 individuals in 95 nations (1981-2009), we use three-level hierarchical linear models to test four competing theory-based hypotheses-that unemployment shapes life satisfaction through individual, contextual, additive, or multiplicative effects. Our results support a multiplicative interaction between individual- and country-level unemployment. Unemployed individuals are less satisfied than other individuals, and when unemployment rates rise, their satisfaction drops even further below students, homemakers, and employed individuals; retirees, however, become more similar to the unemployed. We discuss these findings in light of previous theoretical models to argue for a model where individual unemployment is understood in the context of diverse labor force statuses and national unemployment rates. We conclude with policy suggestions aiming to address the negative consequences of unemployment through individualized and contextualized plans.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sou109"},{"Year":2019,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Does it take a village?

The pattern of high shared environmentality, especially for twins, is not accounted for by the strong degree of assortative mating in the data (parental correlation r = .629), nor by direct effects of educational attainment of the siblings on each other. The low heritability-high environmentality pattern indicates a high level of inequality of opportunity for educational attainment in American society at the turn of the twenty-first century, perhaps linked to a greater role of family financial resources in attainment.

We complement past work that suggests that forces of professionalization and counterpressure alter activists' tendency to use violent and disruptive tactics. With data on over 23,000 protest events in the United States between 1960 and 1995, we find that protest events characterized by broadly resonating claims are more likely to employ tactics that are disruptive but nonviolent. By contrast, events espousing narrower claims are more likely to employ disruptive tactics that are also violent. Moreover, when governmental entities are targeted, protests are less likely to witness the use of both violent and nonviolent disruptive tactics.

The results of multilevel regression analysis show that in contexts that provide better insurance against unemployment, in terms of generous earnings replacement, the adverse effect of parental unemployment is alleviated. Moreover, entry gaps between youth from unemployed and employed households are smaller in tertiary education systems with more opportunity-equalizing education policies that provide more financial support to students and reduce the role of private expenditure.

With longitudinal data on bicycle-commuting in sixty-two large US cities from 2000 to 2014, I use fixed-effects regression and structural equation modeling to perform two strong tests of whether the expansion of bikeway facilities induces more bicycling, and whether this effect depends on the strength of environmentalism in a city.

Studies stemming from world society consider how state ties to newly emergent global norms regarding the treatment of LGBT communities are a driver of this process. A shortcoming of these studies, however, is that they do not adequately consider which type of ties to global norms are most meaningful for policy adoption.

The analysis uses a comprehensive point-to-point migration dataset for a sample of robust welfare states, the universalist countries of Nordic Europe, and similarly positioned destinations representing other welfare types to examine destinations' commitments to inclusion, humanitarianism, and welfare generosity. Results reveal no evidence for a magnet effect to the most generous welfare states in the world net of other recognized factors, and even suggest a negative influence linked to the region's high cost of living. Migrants are instead drawn by the promise of social and political inclusion, migrating to destinations where co-ethnics have become full-fledged citizens. Additional evidence points to the role of international commitments to humanitarianism in augmenting flows.

Yet scholarship about cross-national and longitudinal variations in the relationship between class location and policy preferences remains neglected. This paper addresses this important gap in the literature through a comparative, longitudinal analysis of the substantial, cross-national variation of class differences in proredistribution attitudes. To explain this variation, we focus on the role of preexisting policies and engage with an ongoing debate in the policy feedbacks literature. The self-interest approach argues that higher redistribution creates incentives among the upper classes to oppose redistribution, widening the class cleavage. By contrast, the normative approach argues that universal social policy regimes meet the fairness criteria of middle and upper classes, thereby reducing attitudinal differences. Using an innovative data set containing 106 country-years between 1985 and 2010, our study supports the self-interest approach. Countries achieving more redistribution display larger class cleavages in pro-redistribution attitudes, while universalism does not reduce this divide. The study further shows that redistribution and class cleavage are linearly related because redistribution bolsters the already low commitment with inequality reduction in the upper service and lower service classes.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sox068"},{"Year":2017,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"When beauty doesn't pay: Gender and beauty biases in a peer-to-peer loan market","Abstract":"We analyzed a random sample of individual listings from an online market for peer-to-peer lending to examine the effects of gender and attractiveness on receiving loans. In this setting, we tested the theoretical argument that women are penalized for violating beliefs about women's social roles when they seek loans for male-typed endeavors, such as running a business. Consistent with this theory, female borrowers seeking loans for business purposes were less likely to receive funding. Surprisingly, women's facial attractiveness moderated this effect: women seeking business loans were even less likely to receive funding if they were attractive. This result qualifies the conventional notion of beauty as a diffuse asset and underscores the alternative idea that beauty may accentuate perceived femininity and thus exacerbate the disadvantages that women face in male-typed domains. Overall, our research shows that gender beliefs about task-relevant competence can carry over from more formalized organizational contexts into new forms of online transactions that are designed to reduce biases that result from face-to-face interactions.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sox020"},{"Year":2020,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Stuck in place? A field experiment on the effects of reputational information on student evaluations","Abstract":"Studies suggest that students\u2019 prior performance can shape subsequent teacher evaluations, but the magnitude of reputational effects and their implications for educational inequality remain unclear. Existing scholarship presents two major perspectives that exist in tension: do teachers primarily use reputational information as a temporary signal that is subsequently updated in response to actual student performance? Or do teachers primarily use reputational information as a filter that biases perception of subsequent evidence, thus crystallizing student reputations and keeping previously poor-performing students stuck in place? In a field experiment, we recruited a random sample of 832 junior high school teachers from the second-most populous province of China to grade a sequence of four essays written by the same student, and we randomly assign both the academic reputation of the student and the quality of the essays produced. We find that (1) reputational information influences how teachers grade, (2) teachers rely on negative information more heavily than positive information, and (3) negative reputations are crystallized by a single behavioral confirmation. These results suggest that students can escape their prior reputations, but to do so, they must contradict them immediately, with a single confirmation sufficient to crystallize a negative reputation.","DOI":"10.1093\/SF\/SOZ097"},{"Year":2020,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Unpacking the drivers of racial disparities in school suspension and expulsion","Abstract":"School suspension and expulsion are important forms of punishment that disproportionately affect Black students, with long-term consequences for educational attainment and other indicators of wellbeing. Prior research identifies three mechanisms that help account for racial disparities in suspension and expulsion: Between-school sorting, differences in student behaviors, and differences in the treatment and support of students with similar behaviors. We extend this literature by (1) comparing the contributions of these three mechanisms in a single study, (2) assessing behavior and school composition when children enter kindergarten and before most are exposed to school discipline, and (3) using both teacher and parent reports of student behaviors. Decomposition analyses reveal that differential treatment and support account for 46 percent of the Black\/White gap in suspension\/ expulsion, while between-school sorting and differences in behavior account for 21 percent and 9 percent of the gap respectively. Results are similar for boys and girls and robust to the use of school fixed effects and measures of school composition and student behavior at ages 5 and 9. Theoretically, our findings highlight differential treatment\/support after children enter school as an important but understudied mechanism in the early criminalization of Black students.","DOI":"10.1093\/SF\/SOZ095"},{"Year":2018,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Disability as inequality: Social disparities, health disparities, and participation in daily activities","Abstract":"Individuals with disabilities experience lower education levels, lower employment rates, fewer household resources, and poorer health than people without disabilities. Yet, despite comprising more than one-eighth of the US population, people with disabilities are seldom integrated into sociological studies of inequality. This study uses time use as a lens through which to understand one type of inequality between working-aged people with and without disabilities: participation in daily activities. It also tests whether social disparities (as suggested by the social model of disability) or health disparities (as suggested by the medical model of disability) explain a larger percentage of participation differences. I first consider if disability predicts daily time in market work, nonmarket work, tertiary (health-related) activities, and leisure-net of health and sociodemographic characteristics. Next, I utilize Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition to assess the relative contribution of these characteristics in explaining time differences. Results from the American Time Use Survey indicate that adults with disabilities spend less time than adults without disabilities in market work and more time in tertiary activities and leisure. There is no difference in nonmarket time. Health accounts for the largest percentage of the explained component of tertiary time differences, but depending on the choice of predictors, sociodemographic characteristics account for as much-or more-of the explained component of differences in market and leisure time. Results indicate the importance of disentangling disability from health in sociological studies of inequality. They also support a hybrid disability model in suggesting that both health and sociodemographic characteristics determine how disability shapes daily life.","DOI":"10.1093\/SF\/SOY031"},{"Year":2016,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Life chances: Labor rights, international institutions, and worker fatalities in the global South","Abstract":"Hundreds of thousands of workers die on the job each year around the world, with disproportionately high fatality rates in the global South. Using fixed effects regression models for 51 countries located in the global South, this research examines how shifts in state context, ties to international organizations, and economic context affect worker fatalities from 1985 and 2002. We find that strengthening collective labor rights-the ability to protest and form worker organizations free from repression-is tightly linked to fewer fatalities. Certain forms of global institutional ties are related to workers' deaths. Increased links to international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) are associated with fewer deaths. Ratification of International Labour Organization (ILO) conventions, however, is decoupled from fatalities. We examine ratification of a specific safety convention, as well as general embeddedness in the ILO, as represented by ratification of the fundamental conventions. Finally, measures of economic globalization, Foreign Direct Investment and exports, have no significant relationship to fatalities, net of socio-political factors. To unpack the mechanisms underlying the quantitative results, we present three illustrations: construction workers in Uruguay, garment workers in Bangladesh, and miners in South Africa.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sow050"},{"Year":2019,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Institutional movement logics and the changing shape of the US social movement field, 1960\u20131995","Abstract":"In this paper, we develop an institutional movement logics approach to analyze the structure and dynamics of the US social movement field from 1960 to 1995.

The analysis reveals the existence of six movement logics of varying breadth, flexibility, and stability.

The present study examines variation in social influence with respect to academic research and citation accumulation. Based on theories of uncertainty, signaling, and legitimacy, the main hypothesis is that disciplinary outsiders are more likely than insiders to cite papers that are already highly cited. The empirical analysis, which spans six disciplines and 13 flagship journals, is based on over 800 articles and the 55,000+ citations they accumulate over a 20-year period. Each citation received is classified with respect to both its timing and the discipline from which it was sent. The results show that the effect of prior citation attention is greater for external citation accumulation even after controlling for the fact that externals adopt later on average than internals. Contrary to intuition, however, outsiders do not appear to uniformly exacerbate citation inequality. The broader implications of this study for diffusion and the sociology of science are discussed in the conclusion.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sou069"},{"Year":2018,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Marriage, family structure, and maternal employment trajectories","Abstract":"Previous studies of maternal employment have focused on marital status differences, but the rise in nonmarital cohabiting parenthood problematizes the simple dichotomy between married and unmarried mothers. Theory and previous research yield mixed predictions as to whether cohabiting mothers' employment will more closely resemble that of married mothers or lone unmarried mothers. Using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, I examine how maternal employment varies across family structures (married parents, cohabiting unmarried parents, and lone unmarried mothers) in the five years after a birth for mothers living in urban areas in the United States. Descriptive statistics show few differences in maternal employment patterns by family structure. Controlling for human capital, however, I find that cohabiting mothers return to work earlier and work more than married mothers. Cohabiting mothers and lone mothers show very similar employment patterns. Additionally, cohabiting mothers who later marry have employment trajectories that are similar to married mothers, whereas married mothers who divorce increase their employment hours. Family characteristics, partner characteristics, and gender attitudes do not explain employment differences between married and cohabiting mothers. I speculate that cohabiting mothers work more than married mothers as a hedge against economic deprivation given high union dissolution rates for cohabiting couples.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sox094"},{"Year":2014,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"The effect of minority\/majority origins on immigrants' integration","Abstract":"This paper develops an inexplicably understudied variable with far-reaching implications for immigrants' experience: whether an immigrant was a member of a minority group in his or her country of origin.

In this study, we ask whether and how working-class men and women in the United States are able to secure gains in wages and\/or earnings as they transition to parenthood or increase family size. We look closely at child parity, employment behavior (e.g., switching employers, taking on multiple jobs, increasing hours), and occupation in the year after the birth of a child. Using the 2004 and 2008 panels of the Survey for Income and Program Participation (SIPP), we employ fixed-effects models to examine the impact of changing labor market behavior or occupation on wages and earnings after the birth of a child. We find limited evidence that low- and middle-skill men experience a \"fatherhood premium\" after the birth of a child, conditional on child parity and occupation. For men, nearly all occupations were associated with a \"wage penalty\" after the birth of a child (parity varies) compared to the service sector. However, overall higher wages in many male-dominated and white-collar occupations make these better options for fathers. For women, we see clear evidence of a \"motherhood penalty,\" which is partly accounted for by employment behaviors, such as switching to a salaried job or making an occupational change.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/soy106"},{"Year":2015,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"The impact of immigrant classmates on educational outcomes","Abstract":"Despite a growing empirical literature on the relationship between immigrant concentration in schools and student achievement, few studies address longer-run outcomes. Using Norwegian registry data, this study addresses the causal impact of immigrant classmates on educational attainment in young adulthood, as well as academic track enrollment and educational achievement in school, within six entire student cohorts in their final tenth grade of compulsory education (310,742 students, 751 schools). Controlling for school fixed effects, native peer characteristics, and observed characteristics of students and their families, we find that students in cohorts with more immigrant peers within the same school have slightly higher propensities to complete upper-secondary education by their early twenties. The effects are about three times stronger among students from immigrant families compared to students with nativeborn parents, and are also robust to adjustment for average grade achievement. Moreover, these peer effects seem to mainly reflect the presence of immigrant classmates from high-achieving origin regions, while we do not find corresponding negative effects of exposure to immigrant classmates from low-achieving origin regions. In conclusion, these results indicate a modest positive influence of exposure to immigrant classmates on, primarily, immigrant students' educational attainment several years later.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sov073"},{"Year":2017,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"When laws are not enough: Violence against women and bureaucratic practice in nicaragua","Abstract":"Despite the passage of numerous laws in Latin America, impunity in domestic violence cases remains a serious concern throughout the region.

Drawing on ten months of ethnographic fieldwork and in-depth interviews, I show how, contrary to theories of representative bureaucracy, the increased presence of women officials within state institutions does not improve most women's treatment by police or prosecutors. Rather, only when women have access to specific forms of social capital are their cases granted legitimacy by state actors. This article illustrates the routine practices by which gendered governance operates, as well as how feminist organizations disrupt patterns of bureaucratic indifference by assuming the banner of legitimacy that is rarely afforded to women victims themselves. These findings raise critical questions about the efficacy of traditional legal and bureaucratic strategies for eliminating violence against women, and suggest that one key alternative is to strengthen the capacities of civil society organizations that provide accompaniment to women victims.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sow082"},{"Year":2014,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"The economic gains and environmental losses of US consumption: A world-systems and input-output approach","Abstract":"Although research has shown that countries' world-systems positions can predict levels of pollution and wealth, there has been little research looking at how consumption in the core triggers both pollution and wealth elsewhere in the world economy.

Nor does it apply general theory to describe the mechanisms or processes through which legitimized elements influence collective action. The laboratory experiments reported in this article test hypotheses derived from a general theory-the multiple-sources, multiple-objects theory of legitimacy. The experiments examine the effects that legitimacy (measured as peer endorsement) and network size have on coalition formation, a form of collective action, and the countervailing of power. The research finds support for the legitimacy arguments. Low-power actors form coalitions more often in networks that highly endorse coalition formation and in smaller networks. Coalitions countervail power, and coalitions in the smallest networks reverse power.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sot116"},{"Year":2019,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Gender Inequality in Product Markets: When and How Status Beliefs Transfer to Products","Abstract":"This paper develops and evaluates a theory of status belief transfer, the process by which gender status beliefs differentially affect the evaluations of products made by men and women. We conduct three online experiments to evaluate this theory. In Study 1, we gathered 50 product categories from a large online retailer and had participants rate each product's association with femininity and masculinity. We find evidence of the pervasiveness of gender-typing in product markets. In Studies 2 and 3, we simulate male-typed and female-typed product markets (craft beer and cupcakes, respectively). In the male-typed product market, a craft beer described as produced by a woman is evaluated more negatively than the same product described as produced by a man. Consistent with our predictions, we further find that if the beer is conferred external status via an award, the evaluation of the beer made by a woman improves by a greater magnitude than the same beer made by a man. In the female-typed product market of cupcakes, the producer's gender does not affect ratings. Together, the two studies provide evidence of an asymmetric negative bias: products made by women are disadvantaged in male-typed markets, but products made by men are not disadvantaged in female-typed markets. These studies also provide compelling evidence of status belief transfer from producers to their products. We draw out the implications of these findings and suggest ways that gender biases in product markets can be reduced.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/soy125"},{"Year":2016,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Disruptive democratization: Contentious events and liberalizing outcomes globally, 1990-2004","Abstract":"Does contentious collective action matter? Whereas most social movement literature has addressed this question in the US context for policy change outcomes, this paper takes a different approach by bringing the question to a global context and examines democratization as a structural outcome. Accordingly, we test several hypotheses about the ephemeral, positive, and negative influences of contentious collective action on the democratization process in a given country, as well as the cross-border effect of the contention. To go beyond the limitations of previous studies, this paper uses a monthly time-series, cross-national model to examine potential liberalizing or deliberalizing effects of protest activities. Using data from 103 non-democratic countries from 1990 to 2004, we find that protests and riots increase the probability that a country will liberalize in a given month. We find that while contentious events in other countries do not directly increase the risk of liberalization, external contentious events, especially those that lead to political liberalization, increase the count of contentious events, thus indirectly boosting liberalization. We find no evidence that protest significantly increases the chances of deliberalization. Together, our findings show a key role for non-elite political actors to influence political liberalization.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sov096"},{"Year":2019,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Contextual Declines in Educational Hypergamy and Intimate Partner Violence","Abstract":"There has been increasing interest in understanding how macro-level contextual characteristics are associated with intra-couple dynamics, such as intimate partner violence (IPV). I extend this literature by exploring whether contextual changes in women's status are associated with IPV at the couple level. I focus on case studies from four Eastern African countries - Kenya, Malawi, Uganda, and Zimbabwe - where there were large contextual declines in educational hypergamy - a measure of women's status - between 2000 and 2010. Using Demographic Health Survey data and a multilevel approach, I find that regional declines in hypergamy are associated with significantly higher probabilities of wives' reports of recent intimate partner violence in Kenya, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. These findings are consistent with relative resource theories that predict that gender-status inconsistencies correspond with backlash, although they extend existing theories by looking at the macro level and considering contextual changes in women's status over time. To the contrary, regional declines in hypergamy are associated with significantly lower probabilities of wives' reports of recent intimate partner violence in Malawi, which may have to do with a long-standing history of matrilineal norms in this context. The analysis enhances sociological understandings of how contextual changes in gender conditions are associated with micro-level couple outcomes, but also points to important heterogeneity across diverse contexts.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/soy085"},{"Year":2016,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Disaster devastation in poor nations: The direct and indirect effects of gender equality, ecological losses, and development","Abstract":"The purpose of this paper is to quantitatively assess the drivers of suffering from disasters across less developed nations, with specific emphasis on the gender relations that potentially mitigate the breadth of devastation across affected populations. We draw on theoretical frameworks of environmental sociology, ecofeminism, gender inequalities, and development to inform our empirical analysis, which represents structural equation modeling of 85 less developed nations. While economic, political, and to a lesser extent environmental factors have been linked, theoretically and empirically, to vulnerability to natural disaster events, few consider the potential of improving women's status to alleviate the toll of disasters on humans in affected nations. Our paper addresses this gap by theoretically developing and empirically analyzing the linkages that connect the environment, women's economic standing, and disaster vulnerability. Our findings point to the beneficial effects of improving women's status-itself conditioned by ecological and developmental factors-to limit the extent of human strife resulting from disaster events in important direct and indirect ways. Conclusions also point to interrelationships among additional social, economic, political, and ecological conditions in determining the distribution of disaster harm and death, such as ecological losses, democracy, underdevelopment, and provisions for health resources.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sow056"},{"Year":2019,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Riding the Waves of Work and Life: Explaining Long-Term Experiences with Work Hour Mismatches","Abstract":"Paid work has become more precarious in the recent decades, prompting many conflicts between employers and employees, including struggles over work hours.

Using sequence analysis and nearly two decades of data from the British Household Panel Study, we find heterogeneous but patterned experiences. Nearly everyone has an hour mismatch eventually (typically overemployment), and most people oscillate between having and not having hour mismatches. Existing theoretical accounts anticipate some hour mismatch sequences, but the data contradict several key predictions. Moreover, no account predicts the most dominant pattern: oscillating overemployment. We thus offer a new explanation, which proposes that hour mismatches usually come in waves but can be generated in different ways. Sometimes mismatches are caused by unstable work schedules. Other times, mismatches stem from inflexible work hours or job demands that intentionally or unintentionally prevent employees from altering their work hours to accommodate changing personal needs.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/soy112"},{"Year":2016,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Neighborhood social processes and adolescent sexual partnering: A multilevel appraisal of anderson's player hypothesis","Abstract":"An increasing amount of sociological research is directed at unpacking the social processes behind neighborhood effects on youth behavioral outcomes.

The index of gender dissimilarity is the proportion of women required to move into the private law firm sector from the public sector to create gender balance. The index of hierarchical market structure is defined by a concentration of elite law graduates, highly leveraged law firms, lucrative billings, and corporate clients. Women's salaries increase more rapidly than men's in these markets, yet men continue to out-earn women. Furthermore, HLM models indicate that in labor markets with greater gender dissimilarity, women's wages are significantly depressed.

Although they are similar to children of immigrants born in the United States (the second generation) they face a variety of barriers to integration due to their lack of legal status. Based on over five years of ethnographic fieldwork with mainly 1.5 and second generation Mexican-American men during a period of major healthcare reform, this paper addresses how citizenship status and embeddedness within multi-status communities impacts immigrant experiences in the healthcare domain. In particular, I argue that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has contributed to an institutionalization of the status differences and a further differentiation in the social integration of these groups of children of immigrants. The novel methodological approach and the data which emerges through fieldwork reveals important insights into the process whereby healthcare reforms have consequences for immigrant communities which I show through highlighting the status-signaling event that is generated through various forms of direct and indirect interaction with the ACA. The implications of this extend beyond healthcare, and I discuss its impact on issues including ethnic identity and psychological well-being.

Culturally, it measures the impact of both personal and societal individualism-collectivism on loneliness. It accounts for social isolation by looking at the separate effects of living alone, emotional isolation, and relational isolation. Using a 2014 European Social Survey sample comprising 36,760 individuals in 21 countries, the study predicts loneliness using multilevel logistic regression modeling using both maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimation procedures. Results indicate that societal individualism may strongly reduce loneliness, even after taking into account that social isolation partially mediates this relationship. Further, the effects of living alone and relational isolation depend upon whether one is personally an individualist or collectivist. Living alone and relational isolation greatly increase loneliness, and such negative effects are somewhat reduced for individualists. However, individualists are not protected from the negative impacts of emotional isolation at all, and the above moderation effects do not hold for the most severe forms of loneliness. Based on this analysis, the best case for reduced loneliness for individualists and collectivists alike is that they maintain a strong degree of multiple forms of social integration and live in an individualist society.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/soy088"},{"Year":2015,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Hispanics at the starting line: Poverty among newborn infants in established gateways and new destinations","Abstract":"High rates of Hispanic fertility raise an important question: Do Hispanic newborn babies start life's race behind the starting line, poor and disadvantaged?

Our results document the disproportionately large share (40 percent) of Hispanic babies who are born into poverty. The prospect of poverty is especially high in new Hispanic destinations, especially those in rural areas.

Second, we illustrate that post-socialist transition (PST) provides a historically novel opportunity to reinvigorate the debate. These countries experienced rapid industrialization but nearly zero FDI under socialism, and we can therefore observe changes in output as FDI accumulates in real time and effectively control for alternative sources of underdevelopment that might otherwise become conflated with FDI. We then estimate growth models that correct for biases owing to country- and period-specific heterogeneity and endogeneity in the FDI\u2192 growth link. Our results suggest that FDI penetration reduces economic growth in the short and long term, and are robust to alternative choices of measurement and econometric specification.

We argue that part of this inequality results from a trade-off between occupational and regional mobility. Both mobility types offer alternative strategies for improving one's labor market position; however, each type also has unique restrictions. The high costs of regional mobility can thus induce occupational changes, even though the resulting human-capital devaluation leads to lower wage increases. We use linked retrospective life-course data for Germany (ALWA-ADIAB) and apply competing risks models to show that restrictions on one type of mobility drive individuals toward the other type of mobility. Using fixed-effects regressions, we then show that regional mobility yields higher wage improvements than occupational mobility does. We argue that restrictions on both types of mobility thus not only determine which type of mobility is chosen, thereby helping explain differential careers, but also contribute to inequality in wage trajectories due to differential returns on job mobility. The trade-off has explanatory power for the inequality between certain actors with different sets of mobility restrictions, such as parents and non-parents or employees in jobs with different skill demands, and it may also contribute to our better understanding of broader patterns of inequality-for instance, that caused by between-nation differences in job mobility.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sow105"},{"Year":2017,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"The commons of the tragedy: Temporary use and social capital in christchurch's earthquake - damaged central city","Abstract":"Garrett Hardin's 1968 essay \"The Tragedy of the Commons\" famously decried the vulnerability of finite communal resources to overexploitation. Yet collective accessibility to and ownership of resources need not necessarily lead to their mismanagement or abuse; rather, the practice of sharing resources can engender positive environmental, social, economic, and political impacts. Social capital, as both the source and product of relational interactions which occur within public space, constitutes one of these benefits. This paper investigates the relationship between temporary communal spaces and social capital through a case study of the Commons project in Christchurch, New Zealand. Generated by both the space itself and the interactions that occur within it, the social capital created in and through the Commons has become a powerful symbol of recovery in a city recovering from disaster. Instead of the tragedy of the commons, therefore, this paper presents the story of the Commons of the tragedy and explores the ways in which social capital has been fostered in and through this space.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sox064"},{"Year":2015,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Learning from performance: Banks, collateralized debt obligations, and the credit crisis","Abstract":"This article investigates how firms in competitive markets use external examples to assess the value of novel practices, focusing on the substantively important case of collateralized debt obligation (CDO) underwriting among US investment and commercial banks, 1996-2007. Diffusion researchers have struggled to adjudicate between competing mechanisms of social contagion, including imitation and learning. I use event-history methods to examine how banks responded to the activities and results of other CDO underwriters. I show that banks learned superstitiously from the share price performance of other CDO underwriters; as the popularity of CDO underwriting increased, banks became even more attentive to confirmatory evidence on this dimension. These findings suggest important refinements to theories of social contagion, especially neoinstitutional theory. By focusing on ordinary organizational processes in an extraordinary context, I uncover an alternative explanation for the rise of complex securitization, with implications for current understandings of the credit crisis.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sov002"},{"Year":2020,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Love the science, hate the scientists: Conservative identity protects belief in science and undermines trust in scientists","Abstract":"The decline in trust in the scientific community in the United States among political conservatives has been well established. But this observation is complicated by remarkably positive and stable attitudes toward scientific research itself. What explains the persistence of positive belief in science in the midst of such dramatic change? By leveraging research on the performativity of conservative identity, we argue that conservative scientific institutions have manufactured a scientific cultural repertoire that enables participation in this highly valued epistemological space while undermining scientific authority perceived as politically biased. We test our hypothesized link between conservative identity and scientific perceptions using panel data from the General Social Survey. We find that those with stable conservative identities hold more positive attitudes toward scientific research while simultaneously holding more negative attitudes towards the scientific community compared to those who switch to and from conservative political identities. These findings support a theory of a conservative scientific repertoire that is learned over time and that helps orient political conservatives in scientific debates that have political repercussions. Implications of these findings are discussed for researchers interested in the cultural differentiation of scientific authority and for stakeholders in scientific communication and its public policy.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/soz156"},{"Year":2018,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Competition for leadership promotes contributions to collective action","Abstract":"Groups often designate a leader to enforce their members' contributions to collective efforts. Prior work has demonstrated that allowing groups to democratically elect a leader is particularly effective at enhancing cooperation once the elected leader obtains the position. Here I go further by considering whether people vie to win elected leadership positions, contributing more to collective efforts even before the leader is elected. Specifically, I demonstrate that groups typically elect their more cooperative members to leadership. Individual members anticipate this and compete for leadership by increasing their contributions to collective efforts when they expect leaders will be elected by voters with knowledge of candidates' prior behaviors, compared to when cooperative behaviors are visible, but leaders will be appointed (Study 1), or when leaders will be elected, but not on the basis of candidates' cooperative behaviors (Study 2). Though prior work has centered on the beneficial effects of elected leadership after an election is held, I demonstrate a novel mechanism by which elections promote cooperation: before the election is held, via competition for leadership. More generally, the results suggest that the leader selection process is a critical factor in determining the success of groups facing collective action problems.","DOI":"10.1093\/SF\/SOY017"},{"Year":2015,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Homebuyer neighborhood attainment in black and white: Housing outcomes during the housing boom and bust","Abstract":"This paper examines the types of neighborhoods that black and white homebuyers have secured loans in during the recent housing boom and subsequent bust.

Multilevel models show that black homebuyers are moving into considerably more racially segregated neighborhoods than their white counterparts and that their access to \"whiter\" neighborhoods did not expand during the housing boom, even after controlling for the racial composition of the metropolitan area and other key ecological factors. Conversely, new white homebuyers have been moving into neighborhoods with greater percent black residents, which may be a contributing factor in observed declines in segregation during the past few decades. Additionally, black homebuyers in metropolitan areas with greater suburban growth were on average accessing homes in more integrated neighborhoods. Finally, the models explained considerably more of the variation in the neighborhood racial composition of whites compared to blacks. These findings are suggestive of a dual housing market, one in which the experiences of blacks are still systematically different than those of whites, despite expanded access to homeownership.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sou118"},{"Year":2015,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"The demography of grandparenthood: An international profile","Abstract":"This comparative study addressed three open questions about the demography of grandparenthood in contemporary societies: First, at what age do people become grandparents? Second, how is grandparenthood sequenced with other transitions in later life? Third, how long is the grandparent life stage? To answer these questions, we analyzed retrospective data from the United States (NSFH) and 24 European countries (GGS, ESS, DEAS). Using survival methods, we estimated (1) age at grandparenthood; (2) demographic overlap with parenting, worker, and filial roles; and (3) expected length of the grandparent life stage. Three central findings emerged from the analysis: First, the timing of grandparenthood varies strongly across countries. Cross-national differences in the median age at grandparenthood are larger than in age at parenthood, age at retirement, and life expectancy. Compared to the United States (49 years among women, 52 years among men), grandparenthood in Eastern Europe occurs up to three years earlier in life; in Western Europe, up to eight years later. Second, cross-national variation in the life-course context of grandparenthood is less pronounced. In all countries, grandparenthood overlaps rarely with active parenting but frequently with worker and filial roles. Third, the length of the grandparent life stage is more strongly influenced by the timing of fertility than by the timing of mortality. The longest years of life shared with grandchildren (35 years) are expected among grandmothers in East Germany and the United States; the shortest (21 years) among grandfathers in West Germany and Spain.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sov066"},{"Year":2017,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"From \"subcultures\" to \"toolkits\": Ethnicity and violence in israeli prisons","Abstract":"Research on violence in US prisons frequently finds higher rates of violence among ethnic minorities compared to whites. Explanations focus on a \"subculture of violence,\" sometimes referred to as an honor culture or code of the street, whereby minorities import a deeply internalized, violent subculture into prison. Subcultural theories of violence have been challenged by scholarship that views culture as providing a \"toolkit\" of frames and scripts that individuals draw upon in different social contexts. According to this model, the importation of violence is far from inevitable, because violence results from the interplay between social context and cultural toolkits. We assess the ability of these two cultural models to explain ethnic differences in prison violence in a different national context by comparing rates of violence among Arab Muslim and Jewish criminal prisoners in Israel. Subcultural models lead us to expect higher rates of violence among Arab Muslim prisoners, while a toolkit-based explanation that draws on social identity research predicts lower rates of violence. We test these hypotheses using both logistic regression and propensity score matching on data covering over 16,000 prisoners, supplemented by in-depth interviews with prisoners and staff. Our results conflict with the expectations of subcultural theories and lend support to culture-as-toolkit explanations. We conclude by discussing the relevance of our findings for research on prison violence, theories of the relationship between culture and violence, and the usefulness of incorporating social identity into toolkit theory.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sow099"},{"Year":2017,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Protest policing alla turca: Threat, insurgency, and the repression of pro-Kurdish protests in Turkey","Abstract":"Why do certain protests prompt more intervention from the police?

Drawing on analytical approaches in the protest policing literature, and on studies investigating the relationship between civil conflict, public opinion, and state repression, this study examines whether pro-Kurdish events in Turkey are treated more severely than others, and how the policing of these protests changes over time. Based on an original dataset, we analyze more than 10,000 protest events that took place in Turkey between 2000 and 2009. Our findings suggest that compared to others, pro-Kurdish events are more likely to encounter police action, one that particularly involves repressive strategies. We further show that repressive policing in pro-Kurdish events is more pronounced when the Kurdish armed insurgency against the state intensifies. Given that this is the first systematic quantitative study on protest policing in Turkey, it not only tests previously confirmed theories of protest policing, but also makes a theoretical contribution by providing a dynamic notion of threat beyond its situational forms, which builds on the conflict between the Turkish state and the PKK.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sox029"},{"Year":2020,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Models and Morals: Elite-Oriented and Value-Neutral Discourse Dominates American Organizations' Framings of Climate Change","Abstract":"Is climate change discourse highly politicized and divisive, or has the debate instead become \"post-political,\" oriented around consensus, problem-solving and administrative management? Adjudicating this debate is important for pragmatic and theoretical reasons. Pragmatically, these divergent characterizations suggest different barriers climate discourse might pose for engaging public concern and citizen mobilization. Theoretically, these characterizations provide different understandings of how elites respond to structural crisis. Using automated text analysis to describe a large corpus of organizations' press releases about climate change from 1985 to 2013 (N = 1,768), I find that this discourse has been largely expert-oriented and technocratic, neglecting concerns of values and identity widely believed to be important for social movement mobilization. Organizations predominantly frame climate change as a problem that, while real and serious, is best handled through the careful and deliberate work of scientific, political, and economic elites. Surprisingly, these observations remain true even among advocacy organizations. These findings provide empirical support that a \"post-political\" framing of climate change, where the issue is discussed in a way that neutralizes social and political power dynamics, dominates American organizations' official pronouncements about climate change. To the extent that earlier scholars are correct that conflict-oriented discursive strategies-such as identification of a common antagonist-are effective at rousing public concern, this discourse is unlikely to mobilize strong public emotion and activism.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/soz027"},{"Year":2015,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Social policy and perceived immigrant labor market competition in Europe: Is prevention better than cure?","Abstract":"Previous research on attitudes toward immigrants has so far focused on composite outcome measures instead of dealing with more specific forms of perceived threat and prejudice. The present article approaches this gap by investigating the antecedents of the perception that immigrants take jobs away from the host-country population. This form of perceived economic competition is a fundamental feature of immigrant-native relations in many countries, and it is embedded in the institution of the labor market. Accordingly, the main interest of this study lies in the influence of two central aspects of labor market policy, employment protection legislation and unemployment benefit level. European Social Survey data are used in multilevel models that include individual-, regional-, and country-level factors. The results indicate that unemployment benefits abate perceived competition, and the impact is strong. This finding is robust against the inclusion of several other policy indicators, including integration policies, welfare regime types, and other structural factors such as unemployment rates and unionization figures. Employment protection affects perceived economic threat only indirectly by mitigating the impact of regional unemployment. Furthermore, it actually increases perceived competition for unemployed persons. These findings challenge the notion that prevention is always better than cure.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sou116"},{"Year":2016,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"\"Take one for the team!\" individual heterogeneity and the emergence of latent norms in a volunteer's dilemma","Abstract":"The tension between individual and collective interests and the provision of sanctioning mechanisms have been identified as important building blocks of a theory of norm emergence. Correspondingly, most investigations focus on how social norms emerge through explicit bargaining and social exchange to overcome this tension, and how sanctions enforce norm compliance. However, sanctioning presupposes the existence of the behavior at which it is directed, and the question of how behavior worth sanctioning can emerge tacitly if communication is not possible has hitherto received little attention. Here, we argue that game theory offers an ideal framework for theorizing about emergent behavioral regularities and show how latent norms can emerge from actors' recurring encounters in similar social dilemmas. We conduct two experiments in which small groups of subjects interact repeatedly in a volunteer's dilemma. We vary the heterogeneity of group members in terms of their costs of cooperation and the way they encounter each other in subsequent interactions. Our results show that subjects in homogeneous groups take turns at cooperating, whereas in heterogeneous groups mostly the subjects with the lowest costs cooperate. The emergence of solitary cooperation is moderated by the way subjects encounter each other again and their other-regarding preferences.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sov107"},{"Year":2018,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Labor Unions and political participation in comparative perspective","Abstract":"This research uses comparative survey data to examine the effects of labor union membership on individual political participation. We argue that national political institutions-specifically, democracy and corporatism-shape the ways that unions mobilize their members to engage in the political sphere. Democratic regimes provide structural opportunities and cultural repertoires that lead unions to focus on member mobilization, especially via contentious politics and political parties. Corporatism, which directly links unions to state structures, undercuts the logics and incentives for union mobilization. We draw upon historical cases of Germany, the United States, Chile, and Egypt to illustrate how democracy and corporatism shape unions' mobilization efforts. Multilevel models of World Values Survey data from roughly 60 countries find that union members participate more than non-members across a range of electoral and extra-institutional political acts, such as demonstrating, occupying buildings, signing petitions, party work, and so forth. In democratic societies, such effects are stronger and participation shifts toward parties and contentious politics. In less democratic societies, union members are particularly likely to work with and through other political organizations. Corporatist arrangements generally dampen the political activities of union members.","DOI":"10.1093\/SF\/SOY044"},{"Year":2019,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Straight Identity and Same-Sex Desire: Conservatism, Homophobia, and Straight Culture","Abstract":"This paper uses the 2013-2015 NSFG, a representative US-based dataset of individuals 15-44, to explore predictors of straight identification among all women and men and among subsets with substantial same-sex activity and\/or attraction. After controlling for attractions and sexual practices, homophobia predicted straight identification in all groups. Among both groups of women, one femininity attitude and motherhood also predicted straight identification. One attitude reflecting alignment with normative masculinity significantly predicted straight identification among men with substantial same-sex activity and\/or attraction. This paper also uses two waves of Add Health, a representative survey of young adults, to examine change to sexual identity over six years. Results show that among individuals who changed sexual identities between waves, heightened religiosity and political conservatism across waves were associated with increased odds of changing to a straight identity for women, but not for men. This suggests but does not prove a directional association between attitudes and identification for some individuals. Latent class analyses also found distinct groups of straight-identified men and women with substantial same-sex activity and\/or attraction, indicating that it is a heterogeneous population in terms of attitudes, including homophobia. This suggests that straight identification is due partly to embeddedness in straight culture and enjoyment of straight privilege, not simply homophobia. While impossible to determine causality, the results show that straight identification is strongly related to non-sexual social factors, including religiosity and attitudes about sexuality and gender, in addition to attractions and sexual practices. The results also suggest that homophobia is related to identity formation for women, as well as men, but that there is substantial within-group variation.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/soy064"},{"Year":2014,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Skin tone stratification among black Americans, 2001-2003","Abstract":"In the past few decades, a dedicated collection of scholars have examined the matter of skin tone stratification within the black American population and found that complexion has significant net effects on a variety of stratification outcomes.

This leaves the question of whether or not the effect of skin tone on stratification outcomes remains decades later. Newly available data from the National Survey of American Life (2001-2003) are used to examine this question. I find that skin tone is significantly associated with black Americans' educational attainment, household income, occupational status, and even the skin tone and educational attainment of their spouses. Consequently, this study demonstrates that skin tone stratification among black Americans persists into the 21st century.

To verify this argument, I examine CEO dismissal and post-dismissal strategic change in large U.S. companies between 1984 and 2007, when the field in which these firms were embedded was characterized by the prominence of the norms of corporate restructuring for shareholders. My findings are three-fold. First, the effect of performance declines on CEO dismissal was intensified by the extent to which CEOs held a record of deviation from the norms of restructuring - i.e., that of increasing assets, employees, and unrelated diversification. Second, new CEOs were more inclined to engage in restructuring when they took office following the dismissal of predecessors with a record of deviation. Finally, those patterns of CEO dismissal and post-dismissal restructuring became more evident over time as the norms developed. Meanwhile, the findings did not apply prior to the shareholder value era. Consequently, this paper suggests that institutional norms act as interpretive frameworks that enable a board of directors to make sense of performance problems and evaluate managerial competence to resolve those problems.

In particular, the literature debates whether exposure to ethnic others in local contexts generates conflict that mobilizes individuals to vote (mobilization theory), diminishes social cohesion that in turn makes voters likely to withdraw from voting (marginalization theory), or does not impact turnout at all. This study is one of the first to investigate the question using individual-level longitudinal data, which adds substantially to the causal leverage of the analysis. In particular, we use a panel dataset with validated turnout data for 1.9 million Danish voters combined with detailed data regarding the ethnic composition of individuals' proximate residential neighborhood. The results suggest that increasing shares of immigrants does not affect natives' propensity to vote to any substantive extent, irrespective of how the size of the neighborhood is specified. This finding cannot be ascribed to lack of statistical power. Hereby, the study provides an important contribution to the existing knowledge regarding the democratic consequences of continuing immigration and increasing ethnic diversity.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sow093"},{"Year":2018,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"The age of belonging: Friendship formation after residential mobility","Abstract":"Neighborhoods are an important social context for children's development; however, a growing body of research illustrates that there is often significant heterogeneity in how neighborhoods influence children's outcomes. Scholars have therefore focused greater attention on understanding neighborhood effect heterogeneity and the social processes that underpin this variation. Recent quantitative work has pointed to heterogeneity by age in the effects of moving to low-poverty neighborhoods, but questions remain about the mechanisms that explain why youth of different ages have divergent outcomes after this move. This paper examines the social processes that drive differences in neighborhood effects by age through analysis of qualitative interviews with low-income Black youth who moved to lowerpoverty and more racially integrated neighborhoods with a housing mobility program. The findings show that the process of friendship formation serves as an important mechanism for age differences in school engagement after moving to non-poor neighborhoods. Adolescents in this sample hesitated to form new friendships after moving, choosing a strategically cautious approach to engaging with new peers. In contrast, youth who moved during middle childhood quickly formed friendships in their new communities. These new friends then encouraged children's engagement and motivation in their new schools, amplifying the potential for children to experience positive educational effects following this move. Younger youth experienced the dual advantages of less exposure to high-poverty neighborhoods and an easier process of establishing new friendships in their suburban communities.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/soy062"},{"Year":2019,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Starting Points: Divergent Trajectories of Labor Market Integration among U.S. Lawful Permanent Residents","Abstract":"Legal status is a growing dimension of inequality among immigrants in the U.S. Scholars have suggested that the legal status with which immigrants enter the country stratifies their short- and long-term opportunities for labor market integration. However, much quantitative immigration scholarship modeling the relationship between legal status and labor market integration treats legal status as static. In reality, immigrants change statuses dynamically throughout their lives. This article uses a dynamic conceptualization of legal status, as well as nationally representative data and regression and propensity score weighting techniques, to examine whether five initial legal statuses are associated with divergent labor market trajectories even after those statuses change. I find that initial legal statuses - which I refer to as starting points - are associated with ordered differences in immigrants' occupational positions immediately after immigrants change status to lawful permanent residence. These differences persist over time. Five years after all immigrants share lawful permanent residence, employment visa holders maintain more prestigious jobs; immigrants with family reunification and diversity status are in the middle; and immigrants with refugee status and undocumented experience have less prestigious jobs. This article demonstrates aggregate, longitudinal patterns of stratification among a nationally representative sample of permanent residents. The findings suggest the importance of modeling legal status as a dynamic rather than static category to reflect the continued influence of legal status starting points on immigrants' labor market integration.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/soy128"},{"Year":2018,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Status and career mobility in organizational fields: Chefs and restaurants in the United States, 1990-2013","Abstract":"Using a set of user-generated data, we examine patterns in the careers of professional chefs. We argue that this is one of many cases in which careers must be understood as shaped by dual structures-the typical occupational structure within a firm, and the organization of firms in a larger field. We then demonstrate how career trajectories may be formalized as movement through a two-dimensional space defined by status in these structures. Building on previous ethnographic work finding that chefs understand the logic of their careers as involving repeated trade-offs between their occupational status (their rank within the kitchen) and organizational status (the status of the restaurant at which they work), we attempt to determine how different trajectories are associated with different outcomes. We find that, despite the somewhat random nature of entrance into the culinary profession, future top-tier chefs disproportionately begin their careers at high-status restaurants. Beyond their auspicious beginnings, these top-chefs-to-be also commonly devote their early careers to maximizing organizational status, forgoing promotions to higher kitchen ranks in favor of low-level jobs at more prestigious restaurants. By comparison, chefs destined to run lower-status restaurants tend to spend their early careers prioritizing rapid advancement within the kitchen, only pursuing jobs at more prestigious restaurants much later in their careers, with limited success.","DOI":"10.1093\/SF\/SOY024"},{"Year":2019,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"The Contribution of National Income Inequality to Regional Economic Divergence","Abstract":"After more than a century of convergence, the economic fortunes of rich and poor regions of the United States have diverged dramatically over the last 40 years.

In this paper I use counterfactual simulations based on Census microdata to understand the dynamics of regional divergence. I first show that regional divergence has primarily resulted from the richest people and places pulling away from the rest of the country. I then estimate the relative contributions to regional divergence of two major socioeconomic trends of recent decades: the sorting of people across metro areas by income level and the national rise in income inequality. I show that the national rise in income inequality is sufficient on its own to account for more than half of the observed divergence across regions, while income sorting on its own accounts for less than a quarter. The major driver of regional economic divergence is national-level income dispersion that has exacerbated preexisting spatial inequalities.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/soz013"},{"Year":2017,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Does manufacturing matter for economic growth in the era of globalization?","Abstract":"This study adjudicates between two competing perspectives regarding the importance of manufacturing employment for economic growth with the onset of the most recent round of economic globalization.

While some scholars argue that the global restructuring of manufacturing in the era of globalization presents novel opportunities for development in the South, others suggest that the importance of manufacturing employment for economic growth in less developed countries declines during this period as competitive pressures increase and barriers to entry decline. I use difference models and a broad sample of both developed and less developed countries in the time period 1970-2010 to examine the effects of manufacturing share of employment on economic growth and how these effects have changed over time. First, I find that manufacturing employment has strong positive effects on economic growth net of neoclassical controls for all countries. Second, I find that for less developed countries, the importance of manufacturing share of employment for growth has declined through the course of the time period studied, particularly after 1990. In contrast, my results do not show a similar decline for developed countries. These findings are robust across alternative estimation strategies.

As the poverty concentration paradigm gained traction among policymakers and social scientists, assisted housing policy was overhauled. New assisted housing programs introduced since 1970 have dramatically reduced the geographic concentration of assisted housing units, changing the residential location of many low-income residents. Was this intervention in the housing market enough to reduce poverty concentration? Using national longitudinal data, I find that the deconcentration of assisted housing from 1977 to 2008 only modestly reduced poverty concentration in the 100 largest metropolitan areas. The results are driven by the deconcentration of assisted housing after 2000, when policies had a greater focus on dispersal of assisted housing to low-poverty neighborhoods. My results suggest that even a substantial shift in housing policy cannot make great strides in deconcentrating poverty given the existing landscape of durable urban inequality. Assisted housing policy exists alongside many other structural forces that cluster poor residents in neighborhoods, and these factors may limit its ability to reduce poverty concentration. Moreover, new housing programs rely on the private market to determine the location of assisted units, and the enduring place hierarchy among neighborhoods may influence both where assisted housing is located and its effect on the residential choices of non- assisted residents in ways that undermine poverty deconcentration.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sov069"},{"Year":2015,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Using \"wild\" laughter to explore the social sources of humor","Abstract":"Analyses of the multiple cognitive structures and social effects of humor seldom look at why these tend to center on particular topics. The puzzle of how humor can be highly varied yet somehow constrained by its source \"material\" is explored using a corpus of over 600 incidents, not of deliberate jokes, but of the \"wilder,\" unplanned laughter that occurred during a set of interviews with economists-professionals who at the time (1999-2000) enjoyed an unprecedented degree of status and influence. The analysis finds that the source material for this laughter typically involved three kinds of socially structured contradiction: between ideals and reality, between different socially situated viewpoints, and between experiences occurring at different times. This illustrates how particular kinds of content can have a special laughter-inducing potential, and it suggests that wild laughter may at root be an interactional mechanism for dealing with social incongruity-even for members of relatively powerful groups. It is argued that this could not only help solve the larger puzzle of simultaneous variety and constraint in deliberate comedy, but also explain why the characteristic structures of humor are associated with a particular range of social effects in the first place.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sou106"},{"Year":2014,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Generational inequalities and welfare regimes","Abstract":"This paper uses a new age period cohort model to show that among cohorts born between 1935 and 1975, cohorts born around 1950 are significantly above the income trend in most countries. However, such inequalities between generations are much stronger in conservative, continental European welfare states, compared to social democratic and liberal welfare states. As we show, this is because conservative welfare states expose some cohorts to high youth unemployment and make lifetime earnings dependent on a favorable entry into the labor market. We thus demonstrate that conservative welfare states have put the burden of adjustment to the post-1975 economic slowdown on birth cohorts that could not get stable jobs before 1975, while similar cohort inequalities are much weaker in liberal and social democratic welfare states. In these latter two welfare regimes, the burden of adjustment to the post-1975 economic slowdown was not put on the shoulders of some cohorts relative to others.

Brazil, which is undergoing a relatively rapid nutrition transition and has inadequate health systems, is currently experiencing the consequences of increasing rates of overweight and obesity concomitantly with the consequences of generations of malnourishment. Given this scenario, Brazil is an ideal context for examining the relationship between family socioeconomic status (SES) and adolescent body mass, as well as how this relationship varies across very different regions within the same country and across the body mass index (BMI) continuum. Guided by a framework that integrates nutrition transition and fundamental cause theories, we use unique nationally representative data with measured height and weight for all household members to conduct quantile regression models. The results suggest that family socioeconomic conditions are important theoretical factors associated with adolescent BMI, but that the way in which family SES impinges on adolescent BMI varies across regions characterized by different locations in the nutrition transition and varying levels of economic development. We also find that family socioeconomic disadvantages operate very differently according to BMI status. The results show that the socioeconomic gradient of adolescent BMI varies by stages of the nutrition transition and economic development and across BMI percentiles.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sox028"},{"Year":2018,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Escalating moral obligation in the Wisconsin uprising of 2011","Abstract":"This study uses insider ethnographic and interview data to examine one of the largest sustained collective actions in the history of the United States-the Wisconsin Uprising of 2011. It finds that this event took a highly unusual form due to a social relation that I term escalating moral obligation, a sense of solidaristic duty that grows increasingly fervent as others struggle on behalf of a shared cause. Each of three active groups within the movement engaged in arduous and unconventional resistance to controversial legislation, and did so in a manner that induced moral debt among the other groups. Fervency of commitment to the cause increased as a result of allies taking risky or self-sacrificial actions. Each group felt obligated to continue difficult mobilization as long as others continued theirs. Escalating moral obligation develops a simultaneously emergent, endogenous, and cognitive dimension of social movements. It is a relational mechanism linking political opportunity with actual mobilization. The political opportunity in this case was a combination of several conditions: an elite cleavage over the desirability of public unions, a more local balance of power allowing dissident legislators to obstruct but not defeat legislation, and an immediate severe popular reaction. This mechanism is potentially generalizable to other risky or arduous protests. When activists are motivated by the sacrifice or risk-taking of allied activists, escalating moral obligation is present. The concept links group-level imperatives with individual-level motivations. Escalating moral obligation shows one way that individual subjectivities can change through group interrelations and emotionally intense interactions.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sox091"},{"Year":2015,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Shareholder value and workforce downsizing, 1981-2006","Abstract":"This paper develops a theoretical account of the reconstruction of workforce downsizing as a shareholder-value strategy since the 1980s. This account has two components. First, building on resource-dependence theory, I suggest that growing corporate dependence on institutional investors makes firms susceptible to their demand for greater returns, especially when these institutional investors are blockholders and resistant to counter-pressure from managers. Second, building on Fligstein's theory of conceptions of control, I suggest that the rise of shareholder value reorients managerial behavior, by changing the decision context in a way that induces managers to maximize shareholder value. Crucial to constructing this new decision context are a set of agency-theory prescriptions for reforming corporate governance. My analysis of downsizing announcements, drawing on a sample of 714 US firms between 1981 and 2006, shows that both the pressure from institutional investors and the new decision context encourage firms to downsize more frequently. By demonstrating how both pressure from investors and changed managerial decision contexts have contributed to the prevalence of workforce downsizing, this paper makes a strong case for the financialization of the American corporation, and contributes to the sociological research on growing job insecurity and income inequality over the past three decades.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sou108"},{"Year":2015,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Intrinsically advantageous?

Drawing on interviews with homeowners at risk of foreclosure and a yearlong ethnography of a housing counseling organization, I find that although the housing crisis of the \"Great Recession\" affected both working- and middle-class homeowners alike, the practices of working-class borrowers better positioned them to exploit a number of informational advantages in the rapidly changing mortgage modification setting. My findings are a departure from existing research that treats middle-class capabilities and practices as intrinsically advantageous.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sou087"},{"Year":2017,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Seeing is (not) believing: How viewing pornography shapes the religious lives of young Americans","Abstract":"Pornography has become increasingly accessible in the United States, and particularly for younger Americans. While some research considers how pornography use affects the sexual and psychological health of adolescents and emerging adults, sociologists have given little attention to how viewing pornography may shape young Americans' connection to key social and cultural institutions, like religion. This article examines whether viewing pornography may actually have a secularizing effect, reducing young Americans' personal religiosity over time. To test for this, we use data from three waves of the National Study of Youth and Religion. Fixed-effects regression models show that more frequent pornography viewing diminishes religious service attendance, importance of religious faith, prayer frequency, and perceived closeness to God, while increasing religious doubts. These effects hold regardless of gender. The effects of viewing pornography on importance of faith, closeness to God, and religious doubts are stronger for teenagers compared to emerging adults. In light of the rapidly growing availability and acceptance of pornography for young Americans, our findings suggest that scholars must consider how increasingly pervasive pornography consumption may shape both the religious lives of young adults and also the future landscape of American religion more broadly.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sow106"},{"Year":2018,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Can elites shape public attitudes toward immigrants?: Evidence from the 2016 US presidential election","Abstract":"It is well known that political elites can shape public attitudes toward policies and values.

I test this by analyzing the attitudinal effects of Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign announcement speech, in which he referred to Mexican immigrants as \"rapists\" and \"criminals.\" First, to provide causal estimates, I analyze survey data using a counterfactual approach. I find evidence that Trump's statements negatively affected public opinion toward immigrants particularly among groups with restrictionist tendencies. Second, using a panel survey experiment, I corroborate this causal relationship but find that these effects are short-lived. This explains why restrictionist politicians like Trump constantly prod natives to keep their messages' effects from dissipating. I also find that only negative messages are consequential and find no evidence that elite statements are more impactful than those from non-elites, suggesting that the power of elite rhetoric lies primarily in its capacity to reach the masses via the news media.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/soy001"},{"Year":2017,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"What a Story?","Abstract":"Despite efforts by protesters to develop newsworthy tactics, there is ample evidence that reporters use a few well-defined scripts to construct stories on these events. The institutionalization of protest has only served to amplify the routinization of media coverage. How then do reporters address emergent forms of collective action that fail to conform to existing scripts? The current research investigates this phenomenon by comparing the language used to describe protest in major American cities and disturbances on college and university campuses. Colleges and universities have seen an upsurge of these events, such as disorderly celebrations following sporting contests. In contrast, protest has become increasingly institutionalized. As a consequence, we suspected that coverage of campus community disturbances would draw much more heavily on language that portrays them as dangerous than would coverage of protests. Our analysis of newspaper coverage reveals that even when taking into consideration important event features like the behaviors of police and civilians, protests are covered in a far more routine fashion than are campus community riots, a condition that holds even for the most contentious protest events. These findings provide important insights into the interplay of collective action and media attention, and are especially timely given the recent rise of more contentious events such as the #blacklivesmatter protests.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sox057"},{"Year":2015,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Gene by social-environment interaction for youth delinquency and violence: Thirty-nine aggression-related genes","Abstract":"Complex human traits are likely to be affected by many environmental and genetic factors, and the interactions among them. However, previous gene-environment interaction (G \u00d7 E) studies have typically focused on one or only a few genetic variants at a time. To provide a broader view of G \u00d7 E, this study examines the relationship between 403 genetic variants from 39 genes and youth delinquency and violence. We find evidence that low social control is associated with greater genetic risk for delinquency and violence and high\/moderate social control with smaller genetic risk for delinquency and violence. Our findings are consistent with prior G \u00d7 E studies based on a small number of genetic variants, and more importantly, we show that these findings still hold when a large number of genetic variants are considered simultaneously. A key implication of these findings is that the expression of multiple genes related to delinquency depends on the social environment: gene expression is likely to be amplified in low-social-control environments but tends to be suppressed in high\/moderate-socialcontrol environments. This study not only deepens our understanding of how the social environment shapes individual behavior, but also provides important conceptual and methodological insights for future G \u00d7 E research on complex human traits.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sou086"},{"Year":2019,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Uneven Patterns of Inequality: An Audit Analysis of Hiring-Related Practices by Gendered and Classed Contexts","Abstract":"Despite women's uneven entrances into male-dominated occupations, limited scholarship has examined whether and how employers in different occupational classes unevenly discriminate against women during early hiring practices. This article argues that intersecting gendered and classed features of occupations simultaneously shape hiring-related practices and generate uneven patterns of inequality. Using data derived from comparative white-collar (N = 3,044 r\u00e9sum\u00e9s) and working-class (N = 3,258 r\u00e9sum\u00e9s) correspondence audits and content-coded analyses of more than 3,000 job advertisements, the author analyzes early hiring practices among employers across two gendered occupational dimensions: (1) sex composition (male- or female-dominated jobs) and (2) gender stereotyping (masculinized or feminized jobs, based on the attributes that employers emphasize in job advertisements). Broadly, findings suggest a polarization of early sorting mechanisms in which discrimination against female applicants is concentrated in male-dominated and masculinized working-class jobs, whereas discrimination against male applicants at early job-access points is more widespread, occurring in female-dominated and feminized jobs in both white-collar and working-class contexts. Interestingly, discrimination further compounds for male and female applicants - depending on the classed context - when these occupational dimensions align in the same gendered direction (e.g., male-dominated jobs that also have masculinized job advertisements). These findings have implications for the study of gender and work inequality and indicate the importance of a multidimensional approach to hiring-related inequality.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/soy123"},{"Year":2015,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Non-standard work schedules and childbearing in the Netherlands: A mixed-method couple analysis","Abstract":"This study examined the effect of working at non-standard times on the transition to first and second childbirth.

Seeking to expand this knowledge, we present a theoretical framework of the cultural processes of ethnoracial disadvantage experienced by Native American students in predominantly white colleges. Drawing on 65 in-depth interviews with 50 Native students, we identify four cultural processes of disadvantage: derogatory stereotyping, exoticized othering, delegitimation, and assimilation pressures related to cultural hegemony. Intertwined with these processes is the cultural permissibility of ignorance, a willful dearth of knowledge - and lack of accountability for knowledge - about indigenous peoples, traditions, and histories of oppression which enable these biases and exclusions. Students tend to respond to these cultural processes of disadvantage in three ways: educating others, working to disprove stereotypes, and spanning two worlds. We end by discussing how these results help advance theoretical understanding of ethnoracial bias toward indigenous populations and cultural processes of ethnoracial inequality in the United States more broadly.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/soy103"},{"Year":2019,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"The right to resist or a case of injustice?

The argument of \u201cindulging gendered selves\u201d provides an explanation: students in more affluent settings are less compelled to pursue lucrative STEM careers and more encouraged to indulge gendered passions as a form of self-expression. Extending this argument, this paper uses nationally representative data from China to examine the effect of family privileges on adolescents' STEM aspirations. Two distinct mechanisms are identified: instrumentalism, which considers the instrumental calculation of material security and economic returns in developing career aspirations, and (de) stereotyping, which considers whether family privileges cultivate or alleviate gender stereotypes. Findings show that less privileged girls such as ethnic minorities and those having rural hukou tend to have higher instrumental motivation to learn math, indicating an instrumentalism mechanism; on the other hand, girls with privileges such as higher parental education and more books at home enjoy more gender-egalitarian values, indicating a de-stereotyping mechanism. Moreover, Internet access at home as a privilege can foster gender stereotypes and decrease students' motivation to learn math, and the latter association is stronger for girls than boys. Results suggest the importance of distinguishing the instrumentalism and (de) stereotyping mechanisms and the need for educational programs to refute gender stereotypes.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/soz137"},{"Year":2015,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Work-family context and the longevity disadvantage of US women","Abstract":"Female life expectancy is currently shorter in the United States than in most high-income countries.

While work-family context changed similarly across high-income countries during the past half century, the United States has not implemented institutional supports, such as universally available childcare and family leave, to help Americans contend with these changes. We compare the United States to Finland-a country with similar trends in work-family life but generous institutional supports-and test two hypotheses to explain US women's longevity disadvantage: (1) US women may be less likely than Finnish women to combine employment with childrearing; and (2) US women's longevity may benefit less than Finnish women's longevity from combining employment with childrearing. We used data from women aged 30-60 years during 1988-2006 in the US National Health Interview Survey Linked Mortality File and harmonized it with data from Finnish national registers. We found stronger support for hypothesis 1, especially among low-educated women. Contrary to hypothesis 2, combining employment and childrearing was not less beneficial for US women's longevity. In a simulation exercise, more than 75 percent of US women's longevity disadvantage was eliminated by raising their employment levels to Finnish levels and reducing mortality rates of non-married\/non-employed US women to Finnish rates.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sou117"},{"Year":2015,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Network intervention: Assessing the effects of formal mentoring on workplace networks","Abstract":"This article assesses the effects of formal mentoring on workplace networks. It also provides conceptual clarity and empirical evidence on expected gender differences in the effects of such programs. Qualitative interviews with 40 past participants in a formal mentoring program at a software laboratory in Beijing, China, provide insight into the core mechanisms by which such programs produce network change: access to organizational elites, participation in semiformal foci, enhanced social skills, and legitimacy-enhancing signals. These mechanisms are theorized to lead to an expansion in prot\u00e9g\u00e9s' networks, relative to those of non-participants in formal mentoring. Legitimacy-enhancing signals are theorized to enable female prot\u00e9g\u00e9s to derive greater network benefit from formal mentoring than their male counterparts. Empirical support for these propositions comes from a longitudinal quasi-experiment involving 75 employees who experienced the treatment of formal mentoring and 64 employees in a matched control group. A second empirical strategy, which exploits exogenous variation in the timing of treatment and enables a comparison of the post-program networks of one treated group to the pre-program networks of another treated group, provides corroborating support. These findings contribute to research on the efficacy of formal mentoring, gender and workplace networks, and the cumulative advantage or disadvantage that can arise from network change.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sov041"},{"Year":2020,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Forever homes and temporary stops: Housing search logics and residential selection","Abstract":"Residential selection is central in determining children\u2019s housing, neighborhood, and school contexts, and an extensive literature considers the social processes that shape residential searches and attainment.

Drawing on repeated, in-depth interviews with a stratified random sample of 156 households with young children in two metropolitan counties, we find that parents exhibit distinct residential search logics, informed by the constraints they face. Higher-income families usually engage in purposive searches oriented around their residential preferences.

In addition, because they are often \u201cpushed\u201d to move by negative circumstances, they focus on their immediate housing needs and, in the most extreme cases, adopt an \u201canywhere but here\u201d approach.

But mass incarceration, which has profoundly altered the American kinship system, may also have implications for relationships that span across generations. In this paper, I use data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a longitudinal data source uniquely situated to understand the collateral consequences of incarceration for families, to examine how paternal incarceration has altered two important aspects of intergenerational relationships: children's co-residence and contact with grandparents. Results show that the association between paternal incarceration and grandparent co-residence results from social selection forces, but that paternal incarceration-especially incarceration lasting three months or longer and incarceration for violent offenses-is associated with less contact with paternal (though not maternal) grandparents. More than one-quarter of this negative relationship is explained by separation between parents that often occurs after paternal incarceration, highlighting the potentially \"kinkeeping\" role of mothers and the role of fathers in structuring children's relationships with grandparents. Additionally, these negative consequences are strongest among children living with both parents prior to paternal incarceration and among children of previously incarcerated fathers. Taken together, the results provide some of the first evidence that the collateral consequences of incarceration may extend to intergenerational relationships.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sou062"},{"Year":2014,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"The effect of paternal incarceration on children's risk of foster care placement","Abstract":"Research on the relationship between parental incarceration and foster care placement is limited in three ways: (1) it focuses solely on maternal imprisonment and provides neither (2) strong causal tests nor (3) tests of mediation.

Unemployment is a particularly interesting issue in the partnership context because the ensuing loss of income may affect the entire family. Against this background, we examine how singles and couples differ in terms of unemployment duration and how a partner's income and labor market-related resources influence re-employment. Considering the gender and class differences in labor market participation, we are particularly interested in variations in partner support between men and women in differing economic circumstances. Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP), we find that cohabitation accelerates re-employment, whereas marriage increases the prospect of reemployment only for men. More specifically, the partner's labor market resources facilitate re-employment. Although partner income has no effect in absolute terms, unemployed men and women who were formerly minor earners refrain from re-entering paid work. This pattern is more pronounced among low- and medium-income couples than among high-income families. Unemployment thus strengthens patterns of inequality both between and within couples.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sot130"},{"Year":2018,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"How race and unemployment shape labor market opportunities: Additive, amplified, or muted effects?","Abstract":"The manner in which social categories combine to produce inequality lies at the heart of scholarship on social stratification.

This article develops an alternative potential aggregation pattern-muted congruence-which posits that when individuals evaluate others that occupy multiple social positions about which stereotypes are highly congruent, such as being black and being unemployed, the additional category membership will have limited influence over the ultimate evaluation. Using evidence from a field experiment, where fictitious applications were submitted to real job openings, I examine which aggregation pattern most accurately reflects how race and unemployment shape actual hiring decisions. In line with predictions from the \"muted congruence\" perspective, the findings indicate that racial discrimination is prominent, but that there are limited additional negative effects of unemployment for African American workers.

Using data from a nationally representative survey experiment, we examine whether American heterosexuals differentially attribute love to lesbian, gay, and heterosexual couples. We also examine the relationship between how in love lesbian, gay, and heterosexual couples are perceived to be and attitudes toward (1) granting them partnership benefits (formal rights); (2) the acceptability of their public displays of affection (informal privileges); and (3) marriage. Three main findings suggest that heterosexuals differentially attribute love to different types of romantic couples and that these differences are related to willingness to grant social recognition. First, gay couples are viewed as less loving than both heterosexual and lesbian couples; lesbian couples are seen as equally loving as heterosexual couples. Second, perceptions of love are related to willingness to grant social recognition. Third, perceptions of love matter more for gay and, to a lesser extent, lesbian couples than for heterosexual couples regarding informal privileges and marriage. In contrast, love matters equally for same-sex and heterosexual couples regarding formal rights. The results show that gay couples are penalized most in terms of perceptions of love and social recognition, whereas lesbians occupy a liminal space between heterosexual and gay couples.

We argue that when whites perceive threats to their relative advantage in the racial status hierarchy, their resentment of minorities increases. This increased resentment in turn leads whites to withdraw support for welfare programs when they perceive these programs to primarily benefit minorities. Analysis of American National Election Studies data and two survey-embedded experiments support this reasoning. In Study 1, we find that whites' racial resentment increased beginning in 2008, the year of Barack Obama's successful presidential candidacy and a major economic downturn, the latter a factor previously shown to amplify racial threat effects. At the same time, whites' opposition to welfare increased relative to minorities'. In Study 2, we sought to better establish the causal effect of racial status threats. We found that experimentally presenting information suggesting that the white majority is rapidly declining increased whites' opposition to welfare, and this effect was mediated by heightened racial resentment. Finally, in Study 3 we found that threatening whites' sense of their economic advantage over minorities led whites to report greater opposition to welfare programs, but only if these programs were portrayed as primarily benefiting minorities, not if they were portrayed as benefiting whites. These findings suggest that whites' perceptions that minorities' standing is rising can produce periods of \"welfare backlash\" in which adoption of policies restricting or curtailing welfare programs is more likely.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/soy046"},{"Year":2016,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Preferences in the early stages of mate choice","Abstract":"Romantic partnership is often considered an optimal barometer of intergroup relations.

Second, we present evidence for high inter-temporal persistence in the geographical variation in the density of educational institutions over several centuries. Third, we show that the geographical distribution of later educational institutions depends not only on the distribution of medieval institutions, but also on correlates of medieval exposure to ethnic and religious diversity that are likely to have influenced attitudes. Institutions and culture co-evolve, and the inter-temporal persistence of the density of educational institutions is one mechanism (though probably not the only one) that explains the association between medieval exposure to diversity and twenty-first-century attitudes.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/soy008"},{"Year":2016,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"The effect of category spanning on the lethality and longevity of terrorist organizations","Abstract":"This paper examines the effect of category spanning on the lethality and survival of terrorist organizations.

However, research in this vein has focused primarily on the highest levels of European judiciaries. As a result, we know comparatively little about the implementation of immigrant rights in the lower courts that are charged with enforcing the legal protections of foreigners. Using prosecution data from German criminal courts between 1998 and 2010, this study addresses this gap by investigating (1) the punishment consequences of lacking national membership; (2) sentencing differences between EU and non-EU immigrants; and (3) how the punishment of noncitizens has changed over time. The findings suggest that foreigners punished in German courts receive harsher penalties than comparable German citizens. This punishment gap is observed for both EU and non-EU immigrants; however, there is clear evidence that the punishment gap between German and non-German citizens has waned over the past decade. Taken together, these findings inform ongoing debates on the continued significance of national membership in Western societies and have important implications for understanding contemporary trends in sociolegal inequality.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sov084"},{"Year":2018,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Drug market violence comes home: Three sequential pathways","Abstract":"Awide range of sociological work documents higher rates of violence within households in neighborhoods where violence related to illicit drug markets is prevalent. Existing explanations for this association point to cultural scripts, to an absence of community social control, or to the effects of individual exposure to violence on the propensity to reproduce it. Drawing on in-depth interviews and field observations, we argue that much violence within the home may instead be understood as an extension of the systemic violence of the drug trade. That violence travels into homes by way of three often coexisting sequential pathways: 1) invasion, in which dealers enter homes in search of other drug market participants and families are caught in the middle; 2) protection, in which family members seek to protect themselves and each other from repeated theft of household items; and 3) preemption, in which parents use violence against their children in an effort to prevent more serious violence against them by other drug industry participants. This analysis sheds new light on the impacts of the current governance of drug markets and on the difficult choices faced by families in highly vulnerable contexts, contributing to a theorization of violence as situated not in individuals or groups but in patterned sequences of events.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/soy035"},{"Year":2017,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Hypermobility, destination effects, and delinquency: Specifying the link between residential mobility and offending","Abstract":"Residential mobility is often implicated as a risk factor for delinquency. While many scholars attribute this to causal processes spurred by moving, recent research suggests that much of the relationship is due to differences between mobile and non-mobile adolescents. However, studies in this area often operationalize mobility as a single move, limiting researchers to comparing outcomes between mobile and non-mobile adolescents. This approach is rather broad, considering heterogeneity in mobility frequency as well as variation in sending and receiving neighborhood characteristics. We propose a more nuanced framework to help anticipate how characteristics of mobility experiences may mitigate, exacerbate, or fail to influence adolescent behavior. Drawing on data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) and the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1997 (NLSY97), we demonstrate that \"hypermobility\" has detrimental behavioral consequences, increases in neighborhood disadvantage between sending and receiving neighborhoods are associated with reductions in self-reported offending, and long-distance moves reduce delinquency, but only among adolescents with prior behavioral problems. These results underscore the complex association between residential mobility and delinquency during adolescence.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sow097"},{"Year":2017,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Associational participation and network expansion: Microcredit self-help groups and poor women's social ties in rural India","Abstract":"Group-based microcredit has become a globally adopted anti-poverty intervention. An important institutional variant of this is the self-help group (SHG) model, where non-commercialized lending is done through neighborhood-based savings and lending associations. We examine the effect of women's participation in SHGs in India on their social networks and social capital. We use household survey data, including rich social network information from seventy-five villages in rural Karnataka. In a context where women's interactions are largely restricted to their kinship networks and heavily constrained by rural life and patriarchal norms, participation in SHGs provides opportunities for socially isolated women to form new relationships. Descriptive analyses show that SHG participants, despite being more socioeconomically disadvantaged than non-participants, have significantly more incoming ties from nonkin than both non-participant women and men. After using propensity score matching to model selection into microcredit associations, we find consistent evidence that SHG participants have significantly more ties from nonkin and that these ties originate from other participants. We conclude that relationships formed within SHGs extend beyond the group and constitute important social capital, as women form friendships, give each other advice, and exchange vital basic needs resources.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sox021"},{"Year":2018,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Coming out of the penumbras: World culture and cross-national variation in divorce rates","Abstract":"This paper extends the comparative literature on divorce by theorizing how international institutions and norms influence societal divorce rates.

Formal international institutions and treaties do not explicitly proclaim or codify the right to divorce, but we suggest that new norms regarding divorce emerge from the \"penumbras\" of world culture and diffuse globally.

We find that anti-atheist sentiment is strong, persistent, and driven in part by moral concerns about atheists and in part by agreement with cultural values that affirm religiosity as a constitutive moral grounding of citizenship and national identity. Moral concerns about atheists also spill over to shape attitudes toward those who are spiritual but not religious (SBNRs) and influence evaluations of the recent decline in religious identification. Americans have more positive views of SBNRs than of atheists, but a plurality of Americans still negatively evaluate the increase in the percentage of Americans who claim no religious identification (nones).

A growth-curve analysis of occupational attainment and career progression patterns in West Germany","Abstract":"In this paper, we use multilevel growth-curve analysis to model occupational stratification across West German careers for cohorts born between 1919 and 1971. We argue that a life-course approach gives a more appropriate perspective into social stratification by focusing on the permanence of inequalities across human lives. With data from the German Life History Study (GLHS), our primary interest is in the amount and timing of career progression and the ways in which educational attainment, class background, and cohort context shape them. We confirm previous findings of limited career progression and permanence in occupational inequality. Thus, career mobility can correct for initial disadvantages only to a limited degree. We also confirm the strong role played by the standardized and stratified German educational system, which channels workers into specific occupations with strict boundaries. We find a substantial gross effect of class background, which is strongly mediated by educational attainment for women but not for men. We do not find any general indications of a trend in change across cohorts, although there are some weak indications that men who entered the labor market in the problematic 1970s had weaker career growth. We conclude by discussing the advantages of a life-course approach to occupational stratification and the possibilities of growth-curve analysis to answer pertinent questions in research on careers and occupational mobility.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sou002"},{"Year":2018,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Labor market context, economic development, and family policy arrangements: Explaining the gender gap in employment in Central and Eastern Europe","Abstract":"Twenty-five years after the fall of the communist regimes, the gender gap in employment varies widely across Central and Eastern Europe. This study examines the societal-level reasons for this variation and assesses the impact of different dimensions of neoliberally minded \"economic development\" strategies on gender inequality. We focus on Central and Eastern Europe, a segment of the world not typically addressed in the literature on gender and development. We rely on the 2008 and 2012 waves of the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions survey as well as multiple macro-level data sources to analyze the association between development indicators, labor market context, social policy arrangements, and the gender employment gap. We find that typical growth indicators, global market integration, and social policy arrangements are not at all or only weakly associated with the gender employment gap in this region. Instead, the labor market context, specifically the degree of segregation and the size of the public and service sectors, are more important for shaping women's labor market opportunities relative to men's at both time points. Our findings contribute to the literature on the trade-offs between job segregation and aspects of gender inequality as well as to ongoing debates within the field of \"gender and development\" by pointing out important variations across regions.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sox080"},{"Year":2015,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Civil war and trajectories of change in women's political representation in Africa, 1985-2010","Abstract":"In recent decades, the expansion of women's political representation in sub-Saharan Africa has been nothing short of remarkable. The number of women legislators in African parliaments tripled between 1990 and 2010, resulting in African countries having among the highest rates of women's legislative representation in the world. The dominant explanations for this change have been institutional factors (namely, the adoption of gender quotas and presence of proportional representation systems) and democratization. We suggest that existing research has not gone far enough to evaluate the effects of one powerful structural change: the end of civil war. Using Latent Growth Curve modeling, we show that the end of long-standing armed conflict had large positive impacts on women's political representation, above what can be explained by electoral institutions and democratization alone. However, post-conflict increases in women's legislative representation materialize only after 2000, amid emerging international and regional norms of women's political inclusion. In countries exiting armed conflict in these recent years, women's movement into national legislatures follows a trajectory of social change that is much faster and more extensive than what we observe in other African countries.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sov003"},{"Year":2017,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"The educational backgrounds of American business and government leaders: Inter-industry variation in recruitment from elite colleges and graduate programs","Abstract":"The paper provides new empirical evidence on the educational backgrounds of US business and government leaders.

Industries whose products depend primarily on the manipulation of symbolic media were the most likely to recruit from elite colleges. By contrast, industries involved in the transformation of the material world recruited less often from elite colleges, and this was particularly true for industries that employed comparatively few workers with advanced degrees. We find a relatively low level of association between elite undergraduate origins and executive positions in economy and state but greater proportional concentration by graduate business or law school attended. We discuss the different selection criteria used by elite colleges looking for outstanding students and corporations looking for outstanding executives, as well as additional layers of affinity that may lie behind industry differences in recruitment to executive positions.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sox059"},{"Year":2018,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"\"Going with the flow\": How college men's experiences of unwanted sex are produced by gendered interactional pressures","Abstract":"While scholars are giving greater attention than previously to sexual assault against women, they have ignored the fact that men report unwanted sex as well. This article examines thirty-nine heterosexual men's narratives about their experience of unwanted sex in college. My analysis of these data shows how unwanted sex with women is interactionally produced through a process where men seek to save face and to make sense to others. Unwanted sex relates not only to interactional processes, but also to the content of what is considered acceptable behavior in heterosexual interactions. That is, cultural norms governing gender provide the content for what allows a man to save face and for his actions to make sense to a female partner. In particular, men consent to unwanted sex because accepting all opportunities for sexual activity is a widely accepted way to perform masculinity. Findings also show that men conduct their sex lives in the shadow of presumed gendered reputational consequences. They fear ridicule if stories are told portraying them as the kind of man who does not jump at any opportunity for sex with an attractive woman. Moreover, it seems that women, as arbitrators of men's sense of self, may play an important role in policing masculinity and upholding gender expectations, at least in undergraduate sexual cultures. Amidst current attention to sexual assault on college campuses, I argue for a closer look at the importance of interaction and the implicit gendered rules of what is considered acceptable and masculine in heterosexual interaction.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sox066"},{"Year":2015,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Natural hazards and residential mobility: General patterns and racially unequal outcomes in the United States","Abstract":"This study conducts a nationwide, locally comparative analysis of the extent to which natural hazards contribute to residential mobility in the United States and how this influence varies for racial and ethnic minorities.

Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth-1997 cohort (NLSY-97), this study is the first to assess how college funding is associated with first-term majors and course selection throughout college. I posit that funding sources effectively constrain students' fields of study, such that students choose majors and courses that align with their broader financial circumstances. As funding from loans increases, students are more likely to major in applied non-STEM fields (e.g., business, nursing) and less likely to be undeclared during the first term-particularly if students are from low- or middle-income families. Conversely, as funding from family contributions increases, students are more likely to be undeclared and less likely to major or take courses in applied non-STEM fields. Receiving grants bears little relation to students' major or course fields. These patterns suggest that funding sources entail distinct costs and benefits that may influence college student decision-making, and that fields of study are the product of multiple sources of inequality.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sox042"},{"Year":2019,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"World Society Integration and Gender Attitudes in Cross-National Context","Abstract":"Scholars of world society theory argue that integration in global society is important for shaping national outcomes related to gender relations, but past research has not examined how global society shapes individual gender attitudes.

In this article, I test hypotheses derived from world society theory about the relationship between country-level integration and individual gender attitudes using a broad sample of rich and developing nations. Using World Values Survey data from 64 countries, multilevel models of gender attitudes reveal that increased country-level ties to general and women's INGOs are associated with more egalitarian individual gender attitudes. This pattern holds after accounting for relevant domestic factors, differences based on region and religious tradition, other social and political dimensions of globalization, and time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity between countries.

Here, we couple individual fixed effects and instrumental variable approaches in trying to determine whether specific forms of leisure contribute to gains in test performance over time. We merge a restricted access version of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) Child Development Supplement (CDS), longitudinally collected from 1997 to 2007, with a database of over three million county-day observations of sunlight. We use this proxy for weather to instrument for the variation in physical, outdoor, sedentary, and screen-time behaviors based on CDS time diaries. We find evidence that physical and outdoor activity positively influence math performance, while sedentary behavior and screen time exhibit the opposite effect. Moreover, the effect sizes range from a fifth to more than half a standard deviation per additional daily hour of activity, rendering them meaningful in a real-world sense. Our stratified results indicate that children from less educated mothers and girls seem to be most sensitive to the effects of active and passive forms of leisure.

This study assesses whether gender traditionalism in the parental country of origin has a persistent effect on the labor force participation of partnered second-generation women in the United States. An analysis of 1995-2015 Current Population Survey data supplemented with parental origin country characteristics finds that gender-traditional behaviors, religions, institutions, and attitudes are each associated with a lower likelihood of female labor force participation (FLFP). We propose that the successful intergenerational transmission of conservative cultural repertoires from the first to the second-generation accounts for these relationships. Conservative religious context is the best overall predictor of lowered second-generation FLFP. However, patriarchal attitudes and institutions in the parental birthplace best account for the participation of women with parental origins in Latin America and the Caribbean, while the effect of religious context is strongest among women with parental origins in Asia and Europe.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/soy104"},{"Year":2014,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Are they acculturating?

We ground homicide-suicide in the stream analogy of lethal violence and use three analytical techniques to examine the shared and unique correlates of suicide, homicide-suicide, and homicide. Data come from the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS), a pooled, cross-sectional time-series database of US victims across 46 states from 2003 to 2013. A logistic regression model with robust standard errors clustered across states and year fixed effects on 105,243 suicide and homicide-suicide cases predicts the odds of homicide-suicide relative to suicide across a range of theoretically informed covariates. A multinomial logistic regression model investigates the factors that distinguish 26,243 appended homicide cases (from the NVDRS) from suicide and homicide-suicide cases. And, an item-response-based statistical approach examines the extent to which homicide-suicide perpetrators are primarily homicidal versus primarily suicidal. Results indicated that interpersonal stressors and criminal history increased, while physical and mental health stressors decreased, the odds of homicide-suicide relative to suicide. In addition, the etiology of homicide-suicide more closely resembled homicide than suicide. Finally, almost one-half of the homicide-suicide cases in our sample were classified as \"primarily homicidal,\" while less than one-quarter were classified as \"primarily suicidal.\" Findings suggest that homicide-suicide can be conceptualized as a current in the stream analogy of lethal violence, and that the prevention of homicide-suicide would be better facilitated via screening of violence prevention than suicide prevention programs.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/soy071"},{"Year":2016,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Neighborhood associations and social capital","Abstract":"In the United States, the past 50 years have witnessed a remarkable expansion of formal associations in residential neighborhoods, including homeowners associations, condo associations, crime watch groups, tenant associations, and special-interest neighborhood coalitions.

Drawing on the Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey (SCCBS), we estimate the impact of neighborhood association membership on bonding and bridging social capital in a nationally representative sample of residents. Among non-homeowners, our findings suggest that neighborhood association membership is linked to bonding social capital (such as a propensity to socialize and cooperate with neighbors and a positive perception of impact on community conditions), as well as bridging social capital (such as a greater likelihood of trust in racial out-groups). These benefits from neighborhood association membership are attenuated or reversed among homeowners. The results underscore the need for social scientists to consider the inherent tension in neighborhood associations, as institutions that ensure the protection of property values, on the one hand, and that promote neighborhood cooperation and quality of life, on the other.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sow053"},{"Year":2016,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Opportunity or necessity?

One reason might be that different types of inequalities have opposing effects on the likelihood of conflict. In this article, we posit that educational inequalities are likely to incentivize collective action by inducing grievances, while economic and demographic inequalities may actually dis-incentivize collective action by limiting opportunities for disadvantaged groups to engage in rebellion. We test these hypotheses on a new ethnic dyad database, incorporating 1,548 dyads formed by 290 ethnic groups living in 29 Sub-Saharan African countries. The analysis reveals that educational inequalities are indeed positively associated with conflict incidence, while this is not the case for economic and demographic inequalities. The association between educational inequality and conflict is stronger if the groups are wealthier. A higher joint educational level of the groups is associated with less conflict, particularly under more autocratic regimes. These findings demonstrate that to better understand the relationship between inequality and conflict, it is important to disaggregate the effects of inequalities according to the underlying mechanisms and the political context with which they are associated.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/soy049"},{"Year":2019,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Democracy Misunderstood: Authoritarian Notions of Democracy around the Globe","Abstract":"An intriguing phenomenon consists in the fact that widespread support for democracy coexists in many countries with the persistent absence of democracy itself.

In particular, we study how educational expansion has contributed to the observed changes in mobility opportunities for men across cohorts. Drawing on recently developed decomposition methods, we empirically identify the contribution of each of the multiple channels through which changing rates of educational participation shape mobility trends. We find that a modest but gradual increase in social class mobility can nearly exclusively be ascribed to an interaction known as the compositional effect, according to which the direct influence of social class backgrounds on social class destinations is lower among the growing number of individuals attaining higher levels of education. This dominant role of the compositional effect is also due to the fact that, despite pronounced changes in the distribution of education, class inequality in education has remained stable while class returns to education have shown no consistent trend. Our analyses also provide a cautionary tale about mistaking increasing levels of social class mobility for a general trend toward more fluidity in the United States. The impact of parental education on son's educational and class attainment has grown or remained stable, respectively. Here, the compositional effect pertaining to the direct association between parental education and son's class attainment counteracts a long-term trend of increasing inequality in educational attainment tied to parents' education.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sov045"},{"Year":2020,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"The melting-pot problem?

However, none of this research has directly measured premigration socioeconomic status nor has it directly linked immigrants to their children.

Although premigration socioeconomic status is associated with the first generation's economic outcomes after settlement, many of these differences disappear by the second generation. These results suggest that background is not destiny for immigrant descendants.

Pay gaps net of human capital differences are not chiefly a result of mothers' lower wages vis-\u00e0-vis similar women in a given workplace, but rather stem from the fact that mothers are disproportionately employed in workplaces that pay all employees relatively poorly. Having identified the importance of between-establishment segregation, additional analyses probe support for two theories about underlying mechanisms: compensating differentials tied to family-supportive work contexts, and discrimination. While each plays a role, evidence is strongest for discrimination, with organizational characteristics that tend to reduce opportunities for discrimination also dramatically reducing or eliminating motherhood pay gaps.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sox087"},{"Year":2019,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Frame Variation in Child Protectionist Claims: Constructions of Gay Men and Transgender Women as Strangers","Abstract":"This research contributes to social movement framing theory about frame variation, along with the social problems literature on child protectionism. I extend the theorizing on frames by arguing that frame variation can be a response to new agendas and goals of countermovements and opponents. Specifically, for opponents to rights activism, frame variation can be reaction to the assertion of rights for new protagonists, specifically their entry into new spaces. This study analyzes frame variation of the most deleterious child protectionist claims about stranger danger, assertions that the presence of racial, gender, and sexual others in public spaces will harm children. This paper is a content analysis of political flyers and messages developed by Religious Right campaigns at the state and municipal level between 1974 and 2013; these campaigns framed gay men and transgender woman as threats to children in classrooms and bathrooms. For both gay men and transgender women, these claims were most common at the start of rights advocacy. I argue that challengers make the most overt, deleterious arguments about harm to children when new groups initially advocate for legal rights and access to new spaces; as marginalized groups become more familiar and less \"strange,\" challengers make more covert claims about these groups, as stranger danger claims have waning cultural and political resonance.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/soy077"},{"Year":2018,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Does parenthood foster traditionalism? Childrearing and alterations in gender and family attitudes in Japan","Abstract":"Prior studies of gender and family attitudes indicate that the arrival of a child, a major life-course event, may contribute to shifts in these attitudes. Virtually no research, however, examines attitudinal changes accompanying parenthood in non-Western contexts, where childrearing experiences are likely to differ. Using longitudinal data and fixed-effects models, we investigate how having a child, as well as having a daughter versus a son, is associated with changes in attitudes toward gender and family issues in Japan, a country known for its highly gendered distribution of childrelated responsibilities within families. Contrary to previous findings that parenthood has a \"traditionalizing\" effect in the United States and other Western societies, we find that women in Japan generally become less supportive of traditional gender roles as their number of children increases. They also become more approving of divorce after having a daughter. Conversely, Japanese men experience fewer changes, although they do become less positive about the value of jobs for women with additional children and more negative about a child's impact on the couple after adding a son. We argue that the relatively high tolerance of dissonance between attitudes and behaviors in East Asian cultures weakens the psychological motivation for the Japanese to align their views with their increasingly gendered behaviors upon entering parenthood. At the same time, women's experience with greater gender inequality within the household provides them with more incentives to be critical of gendered practices and institutions, resulting in less traditional attitudes as they have more children.","DOI":"10.1093\/SF\/SOY023"},{"Year":2017,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Labor unions as activist organizations: A union power approach to estimating union wage effects","Abstract":"Amid the long decline of US unions, research on union wage effects has struggled with selection problems and inadequate theory. I draw on the sociology of labor to argue that unions use non-market sources of power to pressure companies into raising wages. This theory of union power implies a new test of union wage effects: does union activism have an effect on wages that is not reducible to workers' market position? Two institutional determinants of union activity are used to empirically isolate the wage effect of union activism from labor market conditions: increased union revenue from investment shocks and increased union activity leading up to union officer elections. Instrumental variable analysis of panel data from the Department of Labor shows that a 1 percent increase in union spending increases a proxy for union members' wages between 0.15 percent and 0.30 percent. These wage effects are larger in years of active collective bargaining, and when unions increase spending in ways that could pressure companies. The results indicate that non-market sources of union power can affect workers' wages and that even in a period of labor weakness unions still play a role in setting wages for their members.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sow108"},{"Year":2016,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Delayed disadvantage: Neighborhood context and child development","Abstract":"Neighborhood effects scholarship suggests that neighborhoods may impart different effects across the early life-course because children's interactions with neighborhood actors and institutions evolve across the stages of child development.

The findings from within-child fixed-effects interaction models suggest that while younger children are immune to neighborhood effects on their cognitive development, older children consistently suffer a steep penalty for growing up in disadvantaged neighborhoods. This neighborhood disadvantage penalty persists among older children despite alternative age constructs. Further, the results are robust to various adjustments for observed and unobserved sources of bias, model specifications, and also manifest as cumulative and lagged effects.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sow020"},{"Year":2016,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"NGOs, INGOs, and environmental policy reform, 1970-2010","Abstract":"We examine the effects of domestic and international environmental nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) on pro-environmental policy adoption using cross-national data.

We use event history analysis to model the cross-national adoption of three major pro-environmental policy reforms between 1970 and 2010: omnibus environmental laws, environmental impact assessment reporting requirements, and national environmental ministries. Results show that international NGOs are strongly associated with pro-environmental reforms, with very large effects. By contrast, domestic NGOs are generally not associated with policy adoption in global analyses. In a subsample of democratic countries, we find smaller effects of domestic NGOs for some outcomes. We find no evidence that international NGOs amplify the effects of domestic ones. While there are compelling historical examples of bottom-up and interaction processes, the broad pattern of environmental policy adoption across the world is better explained by global rather than domestic organizational dynamics.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sow031"},{"Year":2018,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"College for all, degrees for few: For-profit colleges and socioeconomic differences in degree attainment","Abstract":"The recent expansion of for-profit colleges in US higher education has ignited much debate over the potential contributions, and limitations, of profit-maximizing educational businesses to socioeconomic inequality. For-profit colleges have a strong economic incentive to retain students, and can offer innovative services in order to compete with more established institutions. But for-profit colleges may also seek to increase revenues in ways that are not beneficial for student outcomes. Using detailed longitudinal information on a nationally representative sample of recent high school students (ELS 2002), this paper provides the first comprehensive and systematic assessment of the effect of attendance at for-profit colleges on socioeconomic inequality in student outcomes, measured as the attainment of bachelor's degrees. Results from logit models and weighted regression technique indicate that low-SES students that attend for-profit colleges are substantially less likely to earn a bachelor's degree than observationally similar students that attend non-profit open admission colleges. By contrast, enrollment at for-profit colleges has little bearing on the likelihood of high-SES students to earn a bachelor's degree. These findings suggest that for-profit colleges contribute to the maintenance of socioeconomic disadvantage, in that low-SES students with mobility aspirations are paying more for their education and yet are less likely to reap the benefits of their investment.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/soy022"},{"Year":2017,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Beyond disasters: A longitudinal analysis of natural hazards' unequal impacts on residential instability","Abstract":"This study investigates the unequal impact of natural hazard damage on people's residential instability over time by shifting analyses from an event-centered design common in disaster studies to a longitudinal, population-centered approach.

In addition to the population-average effects, we also examine the heterogeneity in the impact of family income volatility for families at the top, bottom, and middle of the family income distribution. Our results suggest that after controlling for a set of family- and child-level characteristics, childhood family income volatility has a negative effect on mental wellbeing, and this finding is consistent across a range of psychiatric outcomes. Furthermore, we show that while children from low-income families exhibit the greatest likelihood of psychiatric disorder, children from families in the middle of the income distribution experience the greatest negative impact of income volatility.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/soaa020"},{"Year":2018,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Occupational devaluation due to feminization? Causal mechanics, effect heterogeneity, and evidence from the United States, 1960 to 2010","Abstract":"Proponents of the devaluation hypothesis claim that occupations experiencing a significant inflow of female workers are devalued, both in status and in pay. We suggest that devaluation is an essentially cultural phenomenon that can be subject to change over time and that is not constant with varying contexts. Our theoretical model connects changing gender compositions in occupations with the formation of occupational gender stereotypes. In combination with a cultural bias that attributes less value to female work, these stereotypes can lead to devaluation. This is a novel view on the mechanics at play in the devaluation process. With US census data from 1960 to 2010, we show that devaluation was restricted to sometimes very specific contexts. A trend toward declining or disappearing devaluation is observed over the entire time span. Given potential cultural inertia and the stability of stereotypes, this result could, however, be an artifact of a deficient testing strategy that focuses solely on changes in occupational gender compositions without taking into account the normative power of the past.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sox077"},{"Year":2015,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Income inequality, intergenerational mobility, and the great gatsby curve: Is education the key?","Abstract":"It is widely believed that countries with greater levels of income inequality also have lower levels of intergenerational mobility. This relationship, known as the Great Gatsby Curve (GGC), has been prominently cited by high-ranking public policymakers, bestselling authors, and Nobel Prize-winning academics. Yet, relatively little crossnational work has empirically examined the mechanisms thought to underpin the GGC-particularly with regard to the role of educational attainment. This paper uses the cross-nationally comparable Programme for International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) data set to shed new light on this issue. We find that income inequality is associated with several key components of the intergenerational transmission process-including access to higher education, the financial returns on education, and the residual effect of parental education upon labor-market earnings. Thus, consistent with theoretical models, we find that educational attainment is an important driver of the relationship between intergenerational mobility and income inequality. We hence conclude that unequal access to financial resources plays a central role in the intergenerational transmission of advantage.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sov075"},{"Year":2020,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Entangled: Evangelicals and gangs in El Salvador","Abstract":"How are the two most ubiquitous community-based organizations in poor Salvadoran neighborhoods-gangs and evangelical churches-connected?

Data from the Religion, Global Poverty, and International Development study, collected in a mid-sized Salvadoran city from 2014 to 2018, show that: (1) family networks link evangelicals and gangs; (2) evangelicals and gangs share community governance; (3) gangs infiltrate congregations; and (4) evangelical ideas and networks penetrate gang life. These findings indicate that the widely accepted \u201chaven\u201d perspective of evangelicals in Latin America is insufficient to explain current empirical complexities.

In these seemingly contradictory situations, what are the mechanisms under which Norwegian households allocate their market and domestic labor? Drawing on both a large set of administrative data and a representative survey, this question is examined from two perspectives. First, we focus on the micro-economic processes and investigate if Norwegian households act according to economic rationality or if they still follow the gender norm \"A man should earn more than his wife.\" Second, we focus on how Norway's contextual factors may influence the household experiences when a wife has better market productivity. We find that a wife with better market productivity, who is thereby facing the risk of outearning her husband, works more hours and earns more than her husband, while doing less chores - behavior consistent with economic rationality. Further analyses show that women's \"higher\" relative market productivity is mainly a consequence of having low-income husbands, and \"higher\" and \"lower\" market productivity women are surprisingly similar in other sociodemographic aspects. Norwegian redistribution policies, through progressive taxation and benefit transfers, seem to mitigate the income differences and promote gender neutrality in a sense that if couples wish to pursue an untraditional division, by preference or by necessity, they seem to be able to do so without being held back by the traditional gender expectations or being very poor.","DOI":null},{"Year":2020,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Immigration and Preferences for Greater Law Enforcement Spending in Rich Democracies","Abstract":"Immigration to rich democracies grew substantially in the 1990s and 2000s. We investigate whether the rise of immigration influenced the novel and salient outcome of preferences for greater law enforcement spending. We propose that these preferences are consequential for policymaking, reflect popular demand for punitive social control, and represent micro-level preferences underlying the politics of criminal justice. Motivated by literatures on criminal justice politics, minority threat, and the fear of crime, we examine whether stocks and flows of immigration influence individual-level preferences for greater law enforcement spending. Using International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) data, we analyze between-country variation with multi-level models of 25 countries in 2006, and within-country variation with differences-in-differences (DD) models of 16 countries with available data in both 1996 and 2006. Both multilevel and DD models show that flows of immigration increase preferences for greater law enforcement spending. Indeed, the coefficients for immigration flows are larger than or comparable in magnitude to the coefficients for any other variable, and are robust net of homicide rates and police officers per 100,000. By contrast, the stock of immigrants is not robustly associated with preferences. The results demonstrate that rising immigration contributed to increasing public support for greater law enforcement spending.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/soz024"},{"Year":2019,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"The Persuasive Power of Protest.

In this paper, I theorize how features of protest can persuade citizens to support demonstrators. In particular, I argue that broadcasting an attractive collective identity by means of diverse, worthy, united, numerous and committed participants (dWUNC) triggers supportive reactions of observers through increasing identification with protesters. I test this argument by exposing respondents to manipulated television news items of a protest event in two video vignette experiments. Study 1 scrutinizes the effect of dWUNC displays in an asylum seeker demonstration on a sample of Belgian citizens. Study 2 replicates this design in the US for the Black Lives Matter issue of police brutality. Both studies show predispositions of citizens to strongly affect favorability towards protesters. On top of these potent receiver effects, however, also the dWUNC features prove persuasive. In both experiments, a consistent pattern of feature effects is found: demonstrations that mobilized more diverse participants, who behaved worthy and acted in unison, elicited more supportive reactions. Study 2 adds that these protest feature effects are in part mediated by increasing identification with the demonstrators. The heterogeneity of protest feature effects is explored.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/soy110"},{"Year":2017,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Cross-national and longitudinal variations in the criminal regulation of sex, 1965 to 2005","Abstract":"This paper analyzes cross-national and longitudinal variations in criminal laws regulating sexual activities.

I argue that the widespread adoption of shareholder value norms of corporate governance constitutes one of the core ideological foundations for explaining how the financialization of non-financial firms was accomplished. At the same time, I suggest that economic sociologists' emphasis on the role of shareholder value ideology tends to obscure the concrete realities of contemporary capitalism and the socio-economic relations that underlie managerial conceptions of control. In this paper, I adopt a dialectical methodology that works at multiple levels of abstraction in order to highlight the internal relationship that exists between managerial conceptions of control and the material processes of capital accumulation. Using data mined from corporate proxy statements, I show that increases in concentrated stock ownership among institutional investors and the use of incentive-based compensation-among other important factors-underlie the adoption of shareholder value strategies in the US forest products sector. I then demonstrate how the pursuit of shareholder value reshaped the US forest products in the interests of the financial community while undermining long-term stability of the industry and the people who depend on it.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sov108"},{"Year":2020,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"The segregation premium: How gender shapes the symbolic valuation process of occupational prestige judgments","Abstract":"Symbolic valuation is an important but overlooked aspect of gendered processes of inequality in the occupation structure.

Less research has examined the symbolic valuation of work, such as how prestigious predominantly-female versus predominantly-male occupations are.

Drawing on insights into and techniques from the sociology of culture and cognition, this study examines the role of an occupation's gender composition in how Americans judge the prestige of jobs, testing key predictions from theories of gender and status. Using 2012 General Social Survey and federal occupation-level data, it finds evidence for a segregation premium: people view gender-segregated occupations as the most symbolically valuable jobs. Both men and women reward gender-segregated occupations with symbolic value, although there is evidence of a gendered in-group bias in which women in particular see women's work as more prestigious, while men see men's work as more prestigious.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/soz145"},{"Year":2018,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"A relational inequality approach to first- and second-generation immigrant earnings in German workplaces","Abstract":"We conceptualize immigrant incorporation as a categorically driven process and contrast the bright distinctions between first-generation immigrants and natives, with more blurry second-generation contrasts. We analyze linked employeremployee data of a sample of 5,097 employees in 97 large German organizations and focus on first- and second-generation immigrants. We explore how generational status in the labor market and workplace contexts expands and contracts native-immigrant wage inequalities. We find a substantial average first-generation immigrant-native wage gap, which is not explained by individual human capital differences or most aspects of organizational context. In contrast, there is, on average, no second-generation wage gap, but there are substantial variations across workplaces. A series of results confirm predictions from relational inequality theory. For both first- and second-generation immigrants, working in a high-inequality workplace is associated with larger wage gaps. Second-generation immigrants perform better in workplaces where they have intersectional advantages over natives, and for first-generation immigrants collective bargaining protection narrows wage gaps with natives. Consistent with ethnic competition theory, in workplaces with very high shares of immigrant workers, the first-generation-native wage gap is larger. In contrast, increased contact between native Germans and second-generation immigrant coworkers reduces earnings gaps, but only up to a tipping point, after which competition processes reappear and earning gaps widen.","DOI":"10.1093\/SF\/SOY021"},{"Year":2016,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"A lack of security or of cultural capital? Acculturative conservatism in the naming choices of early 20th-Century US jews","Abstract":"Past research demonstrates a marked tendency toward \"acculturative conservatism,\" whereby immigrants select given names for their children that are established- that is, popular in an earlier generation of the native population. Prior research has generally understood such conservatism as reflecting a lack of \"mainstream\" cultural capital; established names are popular among immigrants because they are unaware of current fashion. But we argue and show that even when they are aware of current fashion, immigrants may favor established names to affirm their membership in the host society. Comparing given names among World War II Jewish servicemen (born around 1918) with given names in the general US population in 1920, we show that the parents of these servicemen exhibited a pattern of acculturation that was (1) selective (in avoiding popular native names with strong Christian associations, and embracing certain unpopular native names) and (2) conservative (in their tendency to favor established names relative to newly popular names). In addition, our key finding is that these parents favored those established names whose popularity was rising and avoided those whose popularity was declining. This suggests that Jewish immigrants were aware of mainstream fashion, but deliberately chose established names so as to express their membership in American society. More generally, this result indicates that the acculturation process is as much about gaining social acceptance as about becoming adept in the mainstream culture.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sow025"},{"Year":2020,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"When Worlds Collide: Linking Involvement with Friends and Intimate Partner Violence in Young Adulthood","Abstract":"Recent increases in the average age at first marriage have created an extended period during which young adults frequently continue to socialize with friends, even as romantic ties typically become increasingly serious.

Analyses relied on structured survey and in-depth interview data from a longitudinal study of a large, diverse sample of male and female respondents followed across the adolescent to adult transition (n = 928). Consistent with prior work, friends' IPV experience was significantly associated with respondents\u2019 own IPV perpetration.

Preference formation among children is therefore relevant for subsequent occupational outcomes. This study investigates the role of parental socialization and children's agency in the formation of sex-typed occupational preferences using data for British children aged 11 to 15. We anchor agency in observable psychological attributes associated with children's capacity to act in the face of constraints. We focus on two such attributes, motivation and self-esteem. Our findings identify two main sources of parental influence: (1) parental sex-typical behaviors, from which children learn which occupations are appropriate for each sex; and (2) parental socio-economic resources, which affect children's occupational ambition. We find, additionally, that girls with high motivation and both girls and boys with high self-esteem are less likely to aspire to sex-typical occupations, net of parental characteristics. Motivation and self-esteem help girls aim higher in the occupational ladder, which automatically reduces their levels of sex-typicality. For boys, however, self-esteem reduces sex-typicality at all levels of the aspired occupational distribution. This suggests that boys with high self-esteem are better equipped to contradict the existing social norms regarding sex-typical behavior.

In particular, the age of first selection into distinct educational tracks seems important, as the female-favorable gap in educational performance has been shown to widen during the high school years. Using microdata from the European Social Survey and data on tracking age reforms for 21 European countries from 1929 to 2000, we find that reforms promoting later tracking have particularly benefited girls' years of education, net of other influential factors (genderideological climate and demand on the labor market). This finding shows that the rise of women is not homogeneous across institutional contexts: some educational systems are more supportive of the enhancement of women's education than others.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/soy025"},{"Year":2017,"Source title":"Social Forces","Title":"Negligible connections? The role of familiar others in the diffusion of smoking among adolescents","Abstract":"How is the delinquent behavior of adolescents influenced by their peers? Previous studies in criminology have primarily focused on the effects of friendship networks on delinquency, but what is less examined is the influence of weaker and often negligible relationships on behavior. In this paper, we explore the effect of familiar others, namely those socio-demographically similar peers who are not connected through friendships, on the behavioral diffusion of smoking among adolescents. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, we show that, even after controlling for the behavior of friends, the smoking behavior of familiar others has a significant longitudinal effect on adolescents' likelihood of smoking tobacco and marijuana. The results have important implications for expanding our understanding of the social diffusion of adolescent behavior through contextual mechanisms.","DOI":"10.1093\/sf\/sox046"},{"Year":2016,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Gifts among Strangers: The Social Organization of Freecycle Giving","Abstract":"The Freecycle Network, with its millions of members gifting objects to strangers, is a stalwart fixture of the increasingly popular sharing economy. Unlike the wildly profitable Airbnb and Lyft, the Freecycle Network prohibits profit-making, or even barter, providing an altruism-based alternative to capitalist markets while keeping tons of garbage out of landfills. Why do millions of people give through Freecycle instead of selling, donating, or throwing away items? Utilizing participant observation of two overlapping Freecycle groups and a survey of their members, I investigate motivations for giving and the social norms that guide it. I find that while members of other internet-based groups have been found to exhibit altruism and solidarity, altruism and solidarity in Freecycle appear to be secondary. Instead, green-washed convenience takes precedence as members are motivated to give in order to de-clutter their homes in an environmentally friendly fashion and in a way that can expiate guilt from overconsumption. Embedded in local contexts and governed by powerful cultural expectations based on gift exchange and charitable donation, Freecycle givers create a set of social structures that combine with the organization's focus on the environment to downplay altruism and elide inequalities.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spw005"},{"Year":2019,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Neither Here nor There? How the New Geography of Ethnic Minority Entrepreneurship Disadvantages African Americans","Abstract":"Recent research shows that the foreign born utilize both local and long-distance social relationships to become entrepreneurs, affecting immigrants' chances at upward mobility and their contributions to economic development. Scholars have yet to assess how African American entrepreneurs take part in similar types of geographically dispersed business communities. Using multi-level social network analyses and OLS regressions to compare the geography of buyer-supplier ties originating from one immigrant neighborhood and one African American neighborhood in Chicago, this article highlights a unique mechanism that places African Americans at a disadvantage compared to immigrants: a lack of geographic diversity in African American social capital. Immigrant entrepreneurs' social networks, unlike African Americans' networks, connect the foreign born to more people in different places, enabling them to circumvent the limitations of their local communities and accrue more business assets. Contrary to existing research, many foreign-born business owners in this study relied on intra-national rather than local or transnational social ties. These findings challenge researchers to reevaluate the geographic foundations of immigrant and African American entrepreneurship and reexamine how ethnic minority entrepreneurship affects patterns of social stratification and economic development.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spy010"},{"Year":2016,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Affirming Selves through Styles of Care: When, How, and Why Hospital Workers Craft Different Patient-Centered Cultures","Abstract":"Erving Goffman argued that workers in psychiatric wards must enforce bureaucratic rules that undermine the image that patients possess a self while also engaging in acts of deference that uphold it. Since that time, scholars have debated whether other hospital workers now face a similar dilemma as their organizations take on the more impersonal characteristics of a total institution while also promoting an ideology of patient-centered care. Although these writings suggest how care providers relate to their work and talk about patient encounters, they fail to compare the effects of providers' work orientations on how and when they engage in practices that dignify patients. Hence, they shed little light on the conditions under which care workers might craft patient-centered cultures differently. Building on the insights of identity theory and practice theory, we seek to remedy this situation by developing an approach for studying and explaining frontline hospital workers' diverse styles of caring for the selves of patients. Consistent with expectations, we find that hospital nurses who most closely identify with their roles and primarily value them for their social usefulness (rather than their professional advancement or financial rewards) not only perceive more opportunities and engage in more tangible acts to affirm patients' sense of selfhood, but they also more selectively apply practices to situations. We discuss the implications of our results for research on helping professionals, \"internal activists,\" humanizing ideologies, and patient-centered care.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spw002"},{"Year":2020,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Multilevel Effects of Parental Incarceration on Adult Children's Neighborhood Disadvantage","Abstract":"Few studies have considered whether the consequences associated with parental incarceration extend beyond the children who experience the event, and whether the influence of parental incarceration varies by the context in which it occurs.

We consider the interrelated association between individual-and neighborhood-level parental, maternal, and paternal incarceration and the neighborhood children attain in adulthood.

Drawing on 23 months of participant observation and ethnographic research from 2006-2007 and 2009-2010 in four niche markets of Vietnam's global sex industry catering to Western budget tourists, Western transnational businessmen, Viet Kieu (overseas Vietnamese) men, and wealthy local Vietnamese entrepreneurs, I strategically bring together multiple performances of masculinities that simultaneously affirm and contest Western superiority. In lower-paying niche markets that cater to Western businessmen and Western budget travelers, sex bars provide men with the space to project their status anxieties onto women's bodies, affirming Western superiority. In contrast, more expensive bars catering to Viet Kieu and local elite Vietnamese businessmen provide men with the stage to contest Western superiority by capitalizing on this particular moment of economic flux and engaging in acts of conspicuous consumption to display their financial dominance. Together, these four niche markets of Vietnam's global sex industry provide a unique window to examine how multiple performances of masculinity unfold in relation to each other in the context of rapid economic change.","DOI":"10.1525\/sp.2014.12303"},{"Year":2017,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Racial Residential Segregation and the Distribution of Health-Related Organizations in Urban Neighborhoods","Abstract":"Recent research has considered the role of racial\/ethnic residential segregation as it relates to health and health care outcomes in the United States.

Drawing on two years of fieldwork with the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department, it offers an extended ethnographic look at policing dilemmas in the era of immigration control. As the findings reveal, police bureaucracies respond to immigrant residents in contradictory ways. On one hand, the department has an official community policing program to increase trust and communication with Latino immigrant residents. On the other hand, street-level patrol officers undermine these efforts by citing and arresting Latino residents who lack state-issued ID. Thus, alongside ostensibly sincere efforts to incorporate immigrant residents, ultimately, police produce a form of social control and urban discipline through their discretionary decisions.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spv024"},{"Year":2014,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Privatization, business attraction, and social services across the United States: Local governments' use of market-oriented, neoliberal policies in the post-2000 period","Abstract":"Privatization, business attraction incentives, and limited social service provision are market-oriented policies that broadly concern social scientists. These policies are conventionally assumed to be widely implemented across the United States, a world model of neoliberal development. This study takes a new look at these policies, providing a first view of how they unfold across the nation at a geographic scale that drills down to the local state. We document the extent to which localities privatized their public services, used business attraction, and limited social service delivery in the last decade. Extending national-level theories of the welfare state, we focus on two sets of factors to explain where these policies are most likely to be utilized. The first, derived from the class-politics approach, emphasizes class interests such as business and unions and political-ideological context, and anticipates that these policies are utilized most in Republican leaning, pro-business, and distressed contexts. The second, derived from the political-institutional approach, emphasizes state capacity and path dependency as determinants. The analyses are based on over 1,700 localities, the majority of county governments, using unique policy data. Class-politics variables have modest relationship to neoliberal policies and show that business sector influence and public sector unions matter. The findings strongly support the importance of state capacity and path dependency. Overall our study challenges assumptions that acquiescence to neoliberal policies is widespread. Rather, we find evidence of resilience to these policies among communities across the United States.","DOI":"10.1525\/sp.2014.12180"},{"Year":2016,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Ethical Consumerism in Global Perspective: A Multilevel Analysis of the Interactions between Individual-Level Predictors and Country-Level Affluence","Abstract":"Early empirical research on ethical consumerism - the deliberate purchase, or avoidance, of products for political, ethical, or environmental reasons - was primarily individualistic in nature. Recently, scholars have demonstrated the importance of structural and cultural contexts to the explanation of ethical consumerism, rendering explanations that fail to account for such contexts incomplete. Unfortunately, most of this research has been contained within Europe, limiting potentially important country-level variation. Because theories of ethical consumerism suggest interactive relationships between individual- and macro-level variables, the Euro-centric nature of existing research raises questions about theoretical generalizability across all levels of analysis. This study uses the 2004 citizenship module of the International Social Survey Program (ISSP) - a data set that allows for increased country-level heterogeneity while maintaining the highest standards of data quality - to run a series of multilevel, logistic regression models with cross-level interactions between country-level affluence and individual-level predictors. Seven of the eight individual-level predictors analyzed in these interactions are either more influential in high-affluence countries than in low-affluence countries or exhibit statistically uniform effects across the range of affluence. The lone exception is association involvement, which is more influential as affluence decreases. The need to develop interactive models of political participation is discussed.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spw009"},{"Year":2019,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Interpersonal Partner Relationships, Bonds to Children, and Informal Social Control among Persistent Male Offenders","Abstract":"This qualitative study applied a life course framework to characterize the nature of interpersonal partner relationships of Mexican American young adult men affiliated with street gangs during their adolescence.

The results of statistical analyses show that regularized legal status is associated with a significantly lower likelihood of experiencing harassment at the hands of law enforcement agents and other actors alike. Regardless of legal status, however, the analyses reveal significant variations across the three migrant groups, with members of the group that is seen as racially most distinct from the host population having the highest odds of reporting harassment. The analysis of in-depth interviews confirms and expands on these patterns, providing additional insights into the complex expressions and interplay of legality and race in migrants' everyday experiences.

The analysis finds that the transnational repression of these diasporas deterred public anti-regime mobilization before the Arab Spring. I then identify the mechanisms by which Libyans and Syrians overcame these effects during the 2011 revolutions. Activists \"came out\" when (1) violence at home changed their relatives' circumstances and upset repression's relational effects; (2) the sacrifices of vanguard activists expanded their objects of obligation, leading them to embrace cost sharing; and (3) the regimes were perceived as incapable of making good on their threats. However, differences in the regimes' perceived capacities to repress in 2011 produced significant variation in the pace of diaspora emergence over time and guarded advocacy. The study advances understanding of transnationalism by demonstrating how states exercise coercive power across borders and the conditions under which diasporas mobilize to publicly and collectively challenge home-country regimes.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spw019"},{"Year":2018,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"\u201cI'm principled against slavery, but . . .\u201d: Colorblindness and the three-fifths debate","Abstract":"No longer is it acceptable to rationalize racial hierarchy in explicit terms.

Drawing on Antonio Gramsci's theory of hegemony, I advance the thesis that the individualization of environmental politics is due to their skillful management by key corporate interests. In order to deter costly legislation, producers have created and implemented solutions that appeal to environmentalists' concerns, yet in a way that defines individual consumers, not producers, as the source of environmental degradation. The lack of a mass environmental movement enabled producers to organize these solutions on the fertile grounds of civil society.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spx001"},{"Year":2020,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Role Modeling Responsibility: The Essential Father Discourse in Responsible Fatherhood Programming and Policy","Abstract":"Drawing on in-depth interviews and focus groups with 64 poor men of color, this article analyzes how a U.S. federally funded \"responsible fatherhood\" program transmitted a discourse of paternal essentiality, claiming that fathers as masculine role models uniquely contribute to child development. It reveals how, despite lack of evidence that fathers make indispensable gendered contributions to parenting, the focus on male role modeling resonated for marginalized fathers because it characterized them as essential for children's well-being in their capacity as men, not economic providers. Using an intersectional lens, the promotion of paternal essentiality can be understood as a response to the way gender ideologies and race and class inequalities interact to shape norms of responsible fatherhood that discount men of color living in poverty. This strategy relies, however, on an empirically unsupported rationale for fathers' involvement that individualizes the social problems attributed to \"fatherlessness.\" This case reveals how racism, class exploitation, and patriarchy reciprocally shape government-sponsored fatherhood programming and its impact on marginalized men's parenting identities.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spy027"},{"Year":2016,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"The Consequences of \"race and Color\" in Brazil","Abstract":"The vast majority of quantitative research on ethnoracial inequality uses census categories.

Through primary documents and interviews with the authors of the Cadillac-Corning injunction, I offer insight into the primary actors and political struggles behind the prototypical injunction. I argue that prosecutors and police targeted Cadillac-Corning because the neighborhood had undergone demographic change that threatened the boundaries of racial and class separation and control. Despite the sanitization of race in gang injunction policy, fear of black men and stereotypes about black families were central to the rationale of the injunction. The injunction was meticulously designed to control the movement of black youth by criminalizing activities and behavior that are unremarkable and legal in other jurisdictions. The Cadillac- Corning injunction sparked a high-profile court struggle that set the pattern for future injunctions. Today, a protocol is in place that allows the City Attorney's Office, in collaboration with the Los Angeles Police Department, to implement injunctions quickly and with little tailoring.

Using Add Health, we find that white and black boys experience the greatest drops in their grade point averages (GPAs).

We advance current knowledge on educational stratification by identifying the transition to high school as a juncture in which boys\u2019 academic disadvantage widens and high-achieving black boys lose their academic status at the high school starting gate. Our study also underscores the importance of adopting an intersectional framework that considers both race\/ethnicity and gender.

However, our level of ecological disruption is, more precisely, a function of the effort required to exploit natural resources and convert them into the things we value for use and exchange. As the quality of those resources declines in response to historic exploitation, effort increases, and hence so does our ecological impact, a tendency that interacts with social processes to produce emergent outcomes. This effort factor constitutes an important but largely overlooked feature of social-ecological metabolic relations, one that can offer fruitful opportunities for advances in scholarship in environmental sociology, and for environmental monitoring and mediation efforts by states and civil societies.

Second, leaders protected reformed gang embodiment from the risk of being interpreted as a failed masculinity by emasculating active gang embodiment. Lastly, because some subjects had difficulty overcoming rigid facets of masculine gang embodiment - such as drug addiction - recovery provided bodily practices for reshaping and redirecting rigid facets of embodiment. Whereas emerging research on gang exit has built upon functionalist-oriented life-course and role-exit perspectives of crime desistance, this article suggests that embodied, masculine contests are fundamental to the phenomenological realities of gang recovery.

We ask how low-wage workers make resource allocation decisions under conditions of uncertainty by examining how they spend and save their tax refunds. Using data from in-depth interviews with a sample of 115 lower-income working families, we find that more than three quarters of families experienced an income or expense shock in the past three years.

Borrowing from organizational studies, some of these scholars have used the term decoupling to conceptualize the widespread phenomenon of states that sign conventions but do not implement these conventions' norms. In this article, we introduce the concept of differentiated decoupling, arguing that the implementation of human rights norms needs to be rethought and reoperationalized. We present a case study - the right to vote in the United States - to illustrate our argument that it is vital to disaggregate the decoupling processes and examine the different social groups within the state rather than limit scrutiny to the state level. We further contend that in order to explain differentiated decoupling, perspectives developed and used by sociologists who study inequality need to be adopted. In this way, scholars can capture the unequal distribution of human rights in domestic settings and begin to untangle the forces leading to differentiated decoupling. An analysis of differentiated decoupling helps reveal that \"more human rights\" sometimes means more human rights to one group and less to another, suggesting that implementation of human rights norms may even deepen stratification.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spw020"},{"Year":2015,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Liminal Men: Incarceration and Relationship Dissolution","Abstract":"Incarceration, now a rite of passage for many economically disadvantaged minority men entailing an involuntary removal from families, places these marginal men in a liminal state where they are simultaneously members of families and isolated from families. Despite a burgeoning literature documenting the collateral consequences of incarceration for family life, as well as evidence that the deleterious consequences of incarceration for maternal and child well-being stem from resultant relationship dissolution, much less is known about the direct link between incarceration and relationship dissolution. I consider this association with data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a longitudinal survey uniquely positioned to understand the consequences of incarceration for family life. Results show that paternal incarceration is associated with relatively immediate relationship dissolution among parents, the association is concentrated among parents living together prior to incarceration, and is explained by both incarceration duration and changes in relationship quality. And, for couples that survive this initial period, incarceration is inconsequential for relationship dissolution. Taken together, these findings link the literature on the collateral consequences of mass incarceration with the literature on demographic changes in family life, and, given the well-known deleterious consequences of parental relationship dissolution for children, have important implications for intergenerational inequality.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spv015"},{"Year":2015,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Globalization and protest expansion","Abstract":"Evidence of protest expansion both in the United States and abroad has stimulated theoretical discussion of a \"movement society,\" with some arguing that protest activities are becoming a standard feature of democratic politics. In advancing this claim, many have highlighted the role of domestic factors-for example, generational change or economic affluence-without fully accounting for the possibility that international dynamics may play an important role as well. The lack of work is surprising not only because the trend in protest is international in scope, but also because work in comparative sociology suggests globalization may make an important contribution. This study addresses the empirical gap by examining how political globalization (as measured by memberships in international organizations) and economic globalization (as measured by trade activity and foreign investment) influence trends in protest participation. Using data from World Values Surveys of 37,716 respondents in 17 advanced democracies merged with data on several national and international indicators, this study examines how the probability of participating in protest has changed over time as a result of these two forms of globalization. The results of multivariate, multilevel analysis combined with simulations indicate that trends in political globalization have expanded protest activity, while trends in economic globalization have limited that expansion. These results suggest that social movement scholarship should continue to examine the implications of globalization for protest behavior and other social movement dynamics.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spu004"},{"Year":2019,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Motherwork under the state: The maternal labor of formerly incarcerated black women","Abstract":"Although Black mothers are disproportionately represented among formerly incarcerated mothers in the United States, existing research has largely neglected to document the challenges they face in resuming their parenting roles after prison or jail. This study addresses this gap using 18 months of participant observations with formerly incarcerated Black women to examine how state surveillance under post-release supervision and child welfare services shapes and constrains formerly incarcerated Black women's mothering practices. The study develops a typology of three context-specific strategies these women employ to anticipate, react to, and cope with state interventions that threaten their mothering: collective motherwork, hypervigilant motherwork, and crisis motherwork. These findings suggest that contrary to popular constructions of formerly incarcerated Black women as negligent mothers, they navigate multiple, overlapping sources of violence to protect their children. Yet, the labor of navigating the state structures that put their children at risk often placed these women in conflict with the state. This paradox suggests the state criminalizes the maternal labor of formerly incarcerated Black women and that these state logics are used to justify state intervention in Black women's post-incarceration parenting.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spx045"},{"Year":2015,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Disciplined Preferences: Explaining the (Re)Production of Latino Endogamy","Abstract":"While racial intermarriage is heralded as the last stage in integration processes, endogamy (intragroup marriage) is the overwhelming norm in the United States. What are the familial, dating, and community processes that produce endogamy? Drawing from 70 in-depth interviews with heterosexual Latinos concerning dating and marriage, this article reports that surveillance, punishment, and self-discipline harden racial boundaries and induce endogamy. Typically construed as highly personal, romantic preferences are, in fact, socially constructed and policed through family, peer, and community-level processes. \"Third parties\" such as family members, friends, and community members enforce intramarriage via advice, threats, censure, and violence. In turn, outsiders' surveillance and punishment converts into self-discipline, which constrains romantic preferences and choices. To maintain social distance, both non-Hispanic whites and Latinos discipline their kin and their kin's cross-racial romantic interests away from those who stand lower on the racial order. Latinos enjoy racial privilege relative to African Americans and preserve privilege by excluding blacks as romantic possibilities. Latino endogamy is a disciplined response to accumulated racial messages and racial boundary policing. Results show that racial communities are invested in perpetuating endogamy to preserve relative privilege and exert social pressures that largely support the contemporary racial hierarchy.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spv011"},{"Year":2017,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Sexual health and multiple forms of discrimination among heterosexual youth","Abstract":"Research suggests that inequality in material conditions contributes greatly to disparities in sexual health among youth; however, scholars have overlooked the effect of one manifestation of social disadvantage-interpersonal discrimination-on sexual health.

I examine whether exposure to multiple forms of discrimination (e.g., race and gender) is associated with risky sexual behaviors, as well as STI history, teenage pregnancy, and abortion history. The findings suggest that experiences of multiple forms of discrimination are associated with sexual activity, including early sexual debut and multiple sexual partners. However, discrimination is not linked with condom and contraceptive use, or the negative outcomes of (risky) sexual activity.

However, the extent to which countries have reordered themselves along the development hierarchy receives less attention. Accordingly, the present analysis features a systematic examination of cross-national mobility in international development. I first introduce a generic model of mobility in which country-level movement is a function of several factors, including initial inequality, growth dynamics, and temporal span. I then show that observed mobility rates across several development indicators (gross domestic product per capita [GDP PC], human development index [HDI], and life expectancy) are significantly lower than what the generic model predicts. An investigation of longitudinal trends shows that mobility rates have been declining since the 1980s and that the discrepancy between expected and observed mobility has grown wider during this time. Mobility rates appear to be hindered by the lack of large-scale mobility among upper tier countries (where mobility patterns are more favorable than expected) and lower tier countries (where mobility patterns are less favorable than expected). Overall, the results are consistent with propositions derived from world-system theory regarding the relative stability of the core\/periphery hierarchy. In sum, the analysis of mobility can serve as a useful complement to existing research and produces an image of development and change not typically found in convergence studies.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spw011"},{"Year":2019,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Damages Done: The Longitudinal Impacts of Natural Hazards on Wealth Inequality in the United States","Abstract":"This study investigates a largely ignored contributor to wealth inequality in the United States: damages from natural hazards, which are expected to increase substantially in coming years. Instead of targeting a specific large-scale disaster and assessing how different subpopulations recover, we begin with a nationally representative sample of respondents from the restricted, geocoded Panel Study of Income Dynamics. We follow them through time (1999-2013) as hazard damages of varying scales accrue in the counties where they live. This design synthesizes the longitudinal, population-centered approach common in stratification research with a broad hazard-centered focus that extends beyond disasters to integrate ongoing environmental dynamics more centrally into the production of social inequality. Results indicate that as local hazard damages increase, so does wealth inequality, especially along lines of race, education, and homeownership. At any given level of local damage, the more aid an area receives from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the more this inequality grows. These findings suggest that two defining social problems of our day - wealth inequality and rising natural hazard damages - are dynamically linked, requiring new lines of research and policy making in the future.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spy016"},{"Year":2015,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Legitimating contexts, immigrant power, and exclusionary actions","Abstract":"In multi-ethnic nation-states, opposition to immigration has manifested itself in attitudes and behaviors. Past research has typically focused on anti-immigrant attitudes, and relied on threat and competition theories to explain patterns in such attitudes. These theories suggest that perceived threats stemming from new influxes or large concentrations of immigrants should prompt dominant groups to protect their interests, leading to anti-immigrant attitudes. We extend the literature with a focus on anti-immigrant activity, and introduce the legitimating contexts model, which argues that dominant groups may actually hesitate to engage in exclusionary public actions in places where the political and demographic strength of immigrant and ethnic groups is strong. In contrast to theories of group threat, we contend that in contexts with low levels of immigrant political power and demographic strength, anti-immigrant activity is less likely to be noticed, let alone challenged, and thus more likely to become part of he status quo. Extending political opportunity theory, we also claim that conservative elites and voters in local areas coupled with low levels of threat further legitimate anti-immigrant activity. We test these ideas using a new data set of exclusionary action targeted at immigrants in over 50 U.S. metropolitan areas. In support of the legitimating contexts model, we find that low levels of demographic and political threat when immigrants enjoy less power-alone and coupled with a higher share of conservative voters act to legitimate and encourage restrictive events on the part of noninstitutional actors.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spu006"},{"Year":2017,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Lessons on the boundaries of belonging: Racialization and symbolic boundary drawing in the French civic integration program","Abstract":"National civic integration programs for non-European migrants have become increasingly common across Europe. While the official purpose of these programs is to facilitate migrants' entry into society, scholars argue that they may actually reinforce the boundaries that separate migrants from the national community. To address this potential paradox, I propose a theoretical framework that combines the concepts of racialization and symbolic boundaries and effectively locates integration programs in the long historical relationship between Europeans and non-Europeans. In applying this framework, this article draws on an ethnography of the French civic integration program - the \"Reception and Integration Contract\" - and interviews with program staff. I find that the program represents the French nation as modern, secular, and striving towards gender equality, and immigrants as traditional with patriarchal gender relations and public religious practices that conflict with the values of the French Republic. Using these representations, the program discursively draws racialized boundaries between the French nation and participating migrants based on language, culture, and religion. While program personnel with immigrant origins challenge and blur these boundaries, they also often reinforce them and facilitate this process of racialization. Overall, the essentialist and hierarchical representations within the program discourses appear to reproduce the historical contrast between European and non-European and limit the possibilities for boundary crossing and entry into the nation.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spw037"},{"Year":2020,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Input without Influence: The Silence and Scripts of Police and Community Relations","Abstract":"Since its establishment in 1993, the Department of Justice's Office of Community-Oriented Policing Services has invested $14 billion into local police departments' efforts to improve community relations. Yet in 2015, the public's confidence in police reached its lowest point since 1993. Drawing on seven years of Chicago Police Board meeting transcripts, this article identifies one mechanism why, despite police investment, community relations can fail to improve. While community meetings where residents present complaints are envisioned as enhancing citizen voice, police replied to 74 percent of complaints with literal silence. When police were not silent, both police and residents repeated identifiable scripts-defined as stylized narratives based on generalized knowledge from typical events-that reflected divergent conceptualizations of community issues. Police use of silence and scripts are examples of \"perfunctory policing,\" where officers superficially comply with procedural requirements of a program or practice, but resist substantive changes in performance-leaving residents to shoulder the consequences of police inaction. As local jurisdictions invest more into closing the gap between the government and public, insufficient analysis into how initiatives are implemented can legitimize decision-making processes that reinforce the pre-existing social order, rendering community interactions more procedurally symbolic than substantively productive.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spz007"},{"Year":2017,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"To compare is to despair? A population-wide study of neighborhood composition and suicide in Stockholm","Abstract":"Neighborhood context can change the effect of a socio-demographic attribute on the risk of suicide. Eight hypotheses about the interactions between neighborhood composition, ethnicity, income, and socially disadvantaged propositions are proposed based on social support, social comparison, and social regulation mechanisms. They are tested with a population-based dataset of all adults (1.4 million) who lived in the greater Stockholm area in the 1990s. On one hand, multi-level analysis shows that suicide risk increases with the level of affluence in one's neighborhood, particularly among individuals with low income. This supports the notion that income comparison can have negative consequences. On the other hand, social welfare recipients are less likely to commit suicide when there are other social welfare recipients in the neighborhood. Suicide risk among immigrants decreases with the proportion of co-ethnics in the neighborhood, confirming previous findings on social support and suicide. However, further analyses show that the protection effect of having co-ethnic neighbors is limited to immigrants from countries with low suicide rates. This study shows that administrative data can be used to examine neighborhood effects on rare outcomes. The findings are relevant to the contemporary trends towards rising income inequality and ethnic diversity.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spw044"},{"Year":2020,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"The generationing of social assistance receipt and \u201cWelfare dependency\u201d in Ontario, Canada","Abstract":"Adopting a life course perspective, we explore, qualitatively, how receipt of social assistance in Ontario is generationally experienced. Data are drawn from a study of family and generational relationships with Ontario Works (OW), which included in-depth interviews with 31 participants who also had a child or parent on social assistance; we drew from three Canadian cities: Hamilton, London, and Toronto, Ontario. Our thematic analysis reveals that generation matters and in ways less confined than the ideation embedded in the discourse of welfare dependency. Through a life course lens, we find that while older and younger kin may concurrently access assistance, any generation\u2019s entrance onto it must be understood as varying by social, historical, and structural context, which itself varies over their individual life courses. We define this process as the \u201cgenerationing\u201d of social assistance receipt. We further reveal how this generationing interacts with gender, race, Indigeneity, and class. We therefore argue that the generationing of social assistance receipt prompts re-conceptualization of taken-for-granted ideation in the discourse of welfare dependency and, thus, is replete with policy implications.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spz032"},{"Year":2016,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"New Skills, New Jobs: Return Migration, Skill Transfers, and Business Formation in Mexico","Abstract":"Numerous studies have documented a high propensity for self-employment and business formation among return migrants relative to non-migrants. The literature points to the importance of remitted savings, migration duration, and number and types of jobs abroad for business formation upon return. Implicit in this scholarship is the assumption that migrants acquire not only financial capital, but also human capital, which expands their opportunities upon return. Empirical work has demonstrated how the transfer of formal human capital, such as language skills and professional credentials, influences the mobility pathways of professional return migrants. More recent research has also found that the transfer of informal human capital, such as social and technical skills learned on the job, shape the mobility pathways of return migrants with little schooling. Absent from this scholarship, however, are studies that directly test the relationship between the transfer of informal human capital and the odds of business formation among return migrants. In this article, we address this gap. Using a multidimensional skills variable, which includes social, technical, and English language competences, we measure and test the relationship between skill acquisition and transfer and business formation among return migrants. Drawing on findings from a survey of 200 return migrants and 200 non-migrants in Mexico, we show that return migrants who successfully acquire and transfer new skills across the migratory circuit often leverage their new knowledge to launch businesses. Our findings have wide implications for how social scientists conceptualize and measure human capital formation across the migratory circuit.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spw021"},{"Year":2015,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"How to Fight Without Rules: On Civilized Violence in \"de-Civilized\" Spaces","Abstract":"Sociologists have long been concerned with the extent to which \"civilizing processes\" lead to the increasing salience of rationalized behavioral guidelines and corresponding internal controls, especially in social situations characterized by violence. Following Norbert Elias's identification of a civilizing process in combat sports, sociologists have debated, though not empirically established, whether emerging \"no-holds-barred\" fight practices indicate a rupture in the historical civilization of leisure time violence. Using a critical case study of a \"no-rules\" weapons fighting group, where participants espouse libertarian values and compete in preparation for hypothetical self-defense encounters, I ask how the boundary between violence and social regulation is negotiated in an arena that putatively aims to remove the latter. Drawing on more than three years of ethnographic fieldwork, I specify the mechanisms that moderate action: (1) the cultivation of a code of honor and linked dispositions to replace codified rules; (2) the interactional hesitance that arises when participants lack clear rules or norms to coordinate action; and (3) the importation of external rule sets, such as self-defense law, to simulate the \"real\" world. Contrary to surface readings of \"no-rules\" discourse, I conclude that the activity is deeply embedded in larger societal norms of order. Participants' ethos of honorable self-governance, \"thresholds of repugnance\" when exposed to serious injury, and aim of transforming emotive, violent reaction into reflective, instrumental action all indicate that the ostensibly unrestrained violence is, in Elias's technical sense, precisely civilized.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spv014"},{"Year":2020,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Revisiting the Egyptian Uprising of 2011: Exploring the Role of Relational Networks within the Cairo-Based Political Opposition","Abstract":"Revisiting the Egyptian Uprising of 2011, I argue that strong relational networks linking actors in the broader Cairo-based political opposition\u2014a conglomerate of prodemocracy movement organizations\u2014should be understood as a necessary, albeit insufficient, causal condition for the diffusion of protest.

This article analyzes the Colombian informal recycler movement - a \"least likely\" case for successful mobilization due to the recyclers' extreme marginality and the Colombian state's violent repression of labor movements. The article argues that the rise of neoliberalism and the consolidation of democracy created political opportunities that conventional perspectives on the informal economy would not lead us to expect. Three specific links connected these macro-level transformations to increases in the recyclers' collective organizing capacity. First, technical, financial, and symbolic backing from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) enabled recyclers to develop innovative organizing models. Second, new human rights provisions contained in the Constitution of 1991 created an opening to challenge state policy. Third, the privatization of waste management spurred recyclers to action by leaving them with two clear-cut possibilities: waste corporations might permanently displace them, or recyclers might collectively organize to protect and improve their livelihoods.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spw015"},{"Year":2015,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Race, space, and cumulative disadvantage: A case study of the subprime lending collapse","Abstract":"In this article, we describe how residential segregation and individual racial disparities generate racialized patterns of subprime lending and lead to financial loss among black borrowers in segregated cities. We conceptualize race as a cumulative disadvantage because of its direct and indirect effects on socioeconomic status at the individual and neighborhood levels, with consequences that reverberate across a borrower's life and between generations. Using Baltimore, Maryland as a case study setting, we combine data from reports filed under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act with additional loan-level data from mortgagebacked securities. We find that race and neighborhood racial segregation are critical factors explaining black disadvantage across successive stages in the process of lending and foreclosure, controlling for differences in borrower credit scores, income, occupancy status, and loan-to-value ratios. We analyze the cumulative cost of predatory lending to black borrowers in terms of reduced disposable income and lost wealth. We find the cost to be substantial. Black borrowers paid an estimated additional 5 to 11 percent in monthly payments and those that completed foreclosure in the sample lost an excess of $2 million in home equity. These costs were magnified in mostly black neighborhoods and in turn heavily concentrated in communities of color. By elucidating the mechanisms that link black segregation to discrimination we demonstrate how processes of cumulative disadvantage continue to undermine black socioeconomic status in the United States today.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spv002"},{"Year":2020,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Do Bridewealth Payments Reduce Female Reproductive Autonomy?

We hypothesize that bridewealth triggers the application of norms that constrain women's reproductive autonomy and that there are gender differences in those norms. We test our hypotheses using a vignette experiment conducted with male and female participants in Ghana. The results show that participants expected the husband's family and men in the community to react more negatively to a noncompliant wife than the wife's family and women in the community. Whereas men perceived that everyone in the community adhered to bridewealth norms, women expected that men did not adhere to those norms. Rather, female participants expected men to evaluate wives negatively, even for behaviors that are not traditionally associated with bridewealth, suggesting that women live in a more threatening environment than men realize.

It is yet unclear, however, how these expectations respond to changing family circumstances. In this work, we examine how negative family economic shocks affect educational expectations for students and their parents by using two theoretical perspectives - status attainment and adopt-adapt models. Further, we move beyond these debates about the malleability of expectations by considering how this malleability might differ by your place in the social structure. We thus make hypotheses about how social class may buffer or amplify the effect of negative family economic shocks on educational expectations. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we expand our conceptualization of educational expectations beyond degree expectations to include educational institutional route expectations - the educational pathway that students plan to take to achieve their degree expectations. We find that degree expectations are only somewhat malleable, but that route expectations are malleable. Family economic shocks served to reduce students' and parents' expectations for beginning their post-secondary education at a B.A.-granting institution. Further, we find support for the amplification hypothesis rather than the buffering hypothesis; the expectations of middle-class students and parents prove more negatively responsive to family economic shocks than do those of their lower SES counterparts. This work has implications for examining the dynamic nature of the status attainment process and suggests that expanding educational expectations to include institutional route may be vital for understanding social mobility in the current educational climate.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spw052"},{"Year":2019,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Are racial and educational inequities in mass incarceration perceived to be a social problem?

We test whether social desirability bias causes people to over-state their concern about mass incarceration when directly queried. We find that mass incarceration is seen as a problem in the United States, whether the issue is framed by race, education, or as a global outlier. The list experiment reveals that public concern about mass incarceration is not quite as great as overtly-expressed opinion would suggest, and the framing experiment indicates that race-neutral frames evoke greater concern about mass incarceration than an emphasis on racial disparities.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spy017"},{"Year":2014,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Police use of excessive force in minority communities: A test of the minority threat, place, and community accountability hypotheses","Abstract":"We extend existing research on police use of coercive mechanisms of social control against racial\/ethnic minority populations by testing three structural hypotheses regarding excessive force. The minority threat hypothesis maintains that the greater the proportion of minority residents in a city, the greater the use of coercive crime control mechanisms. The place hypothesis argues that spatially segregated minority populations are the primary targets of coercive control. The community accountability hypothesis maintains that organizational characteristics of police departments promote the use of excessive force against minorities. Combining data from several sources for cities with populations of 100,000 or more, we include the key variables of these theoretical models in analyses of sustained excessive force complaints. Findings provide support for the minority threat hypothesis but indicate that place effects are contingent on the existence of a very high degree of racial\/ethnic segregation. They offer little support for the community accountability hypothesis.","DOI":"10.1525\/sp.2013.12056"},{"Year":2015,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Threat, Competition, and Mobilizing Structures: Motivational and Organizational Contingencies of the Civil Rights-Era Ku Klux Klan","Abstract":"While previous studies of ethnic contention and conflict identify important structural and meso-level indicators of threat and competition, analysis of variation in the mechanisms linking these sources of potential grievance formation with mobilization remains unclear. To address this issue, this study explores the social organization of Ku Klux Klan mobilization in 1960s North Carolina. While regarded as a progressive state in the civil rights era, North Carolina exhibited a greater level of Klan mobilization than the rest of the South combined. We build on models of \"mediated competition,\" where ethnic competition and group threat are held as necessary, and propinquity, authority work, and legacies of previous racial violence link threat and competition with mobilization. Extending prior formulations centered on the discrete impact of individual components of competition, we employ fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to precisely specify the conjunctural conditions governing two modes of Klan mobilization: public rally events and the establishment of local organizational units. Our findings indicate that the mobilizing effects of threat and competition varied between rural and urban areas, and that threat\/competition and organization\/leadership play a dual role in translating collective grievances into mobilization.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spv016"},{"Year":2018,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Is the sky the limit? Fair executive pay as performance rises","Abstract":"Recent research documents the public discontent with high income inequality yet an important limitation in our understanding is why such high pay is problematic according to many Americans. This study juxtaposes two explanations for the discontent that many Americans have shown regarding high Chief Executive Officer (CEO) pay: a) that the American discontent with extremely high CEO pay stems mainly from a belief that CEOs are not contributing highly enough to merit such high pay and b) the American discontent with extremely high pay is due to such pay being objectionable in principle. Using data from a national survey experiment (N=989) uniquely designed to test these propositions, this study evaluates the relationship between performance and fair CEO pay. Respondents show aversion to high CEO pay while also embracing the principle of proportionality of rewards and contributions. Findings suggest that discontent with extremely high pay may be reconciled with support for pay for performance: the slope of the pay and performance function may be at issue rather than a hard limit on pay.

In contrast to slavery and legal segregation, color-blind racism is theorized as covert and highly institutionalized. As such, analyses of contemporary racial reproduction often emphasize the structure of colorblindness, particularly the habitual routines and discursive patterns of everyday white actors. Though invaluable, this work may conceal whites' innovation in reproducing, revising, and at times resisting white supremacy and corresponding logics. As opposed to focusing on the structural elements of colorblindness, I elevate colorblindness as a culturally recursive accomplishment grounded in an epistemology of ignorance - that is a process of knowing designed to produce not knowing surrounding white privilege and structural white supremacy. Qualitatively analyzing 105 family wealth analyses produced by white college undergraduates researching racial inequality and the wealth gap, I identify four epistemic maneuvers by which students creatively repaired a breach in normative colorblindness. Demonstrating innovative means by which ordinary whites bypass and mystify racial learning highlights their vested commitment to maintaining and creatively defending the ideologies that buttress racial domination and white supremacy. As such, this research additionally advises updating strategies for challenging whites' colorblindness in efforts to advance racial justice.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spw061"},{"Year":2020,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Racial, religious, and civic dimensions of anti-muslim sentiment in america","Abstract":"This paper examines anti-Muslim sentiment in America.

Empirical analyses utilize data from web surveys and semi-structured interviews collected from undocumented youth activists in California in 2011-2012. Findings indicate that LGBTQ activists encountered significant challenges to disclosing their sexual orientation. Yet these youth comprised a significant proportion of movement participants and they were more civically engaged than their straight peers. I argue that LGBTQ prominence among undocumented youth activists can, in part, be attributed to identity processes within this movement. Specifically, the recognition and activation of multiply marginalized identities at various levels of collective identity formation - at the broader movement, organizational, and individual levels - catalyzed intersectional mobilization, meaning high levels of activism and commitment among a disadvantaged subgroup within an already marginalized constituency. At the movement level, I show how the immigrant youth movement's adoption of the LGBTQ rights \"coming out\" strategy empowered undocumented youth around both their legal status and sexual orientation. This case of social movement spillover produced a boomerang effect by promoting LGBTQ inclusivity among immigrants. At the organizational level, multi-identity work that addressed activists' overlapping identities created inclusive environments for LGBTQ members. Finally, at the individual level, LGBTQ undocumented youth exhibited an intersectional consciousness regarding the multiple forms of oppression they experienced; this, in turn, intensified their activism.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spv010"},{"Year":2017,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"The role of social positioning in observed patterns of material hardship: New evidence from the 2008 survey of income and program participation","Abstract":"Long-term trends in the federal income poverty measure are well documented and researched, but long-term trends in material hardship, as an alternative measure of economic well-being, are much less well known. In part, this is because data limitations have precluded the study of material hardship at multiple data points over time. Using data from the 2008 Survey of Income and Program Participation and repeat observations approximately one year apart, this paper uses probit models to analyze separately four domains of material hardship (i.e., food insecurity, housing hardship, medical hardship and essential expense hardship) in order to identify demographic characteristics that are associated with whether hardships occur and if they are one-time or repeated. The key findings are: 1) across all four domains, experiences of material hardship are evenly split between one-time and repeated, 2) across all four domains, exits from hardship are matched by entrances into hardship, and 3) some demographic factors, such as disability status, are strong and consistent predictors of material hardship across domains and recurrence, while other demographic factors, such as living in a metropolitan area or not, affect domains and recurrence of hardship differently. This analysis not only improves our understanding of how material hardship operates in households, but also demonstrates how material hardship can be a more nuanced and robust measure of economic well-being. Together with future research, these findings can help policymakers create more targeted and effective interventions that help all Americans make ends meet.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spw041"},{"Year":2019,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"\u201cCoal is not just a job, it's a way of life\u201d: The cultural politics of coal production in central Appalachia","Abstract":"Since beginning operations in Central Appalachia, coal producers have economically exploited residents and exposed them to severe health risks associated with pollution. Despite causing these problems, the industry enjoys vigorous popular support. Drawing on nine months of immersive ethnography in \u201cShale County,\u201d this article examines why many Appalachians endorse the coal industry despite its negative externalities. I find that Appalachia's subordinate relationship to the rest of the nation plays a profound role in conditioning the region's pro-industry, anti-environmental views. Many Appalachians feel like the federal government neglects them, and like urban America, devalues them. Drawing upon Antonio Gramsci's theory of hegemony, I show how the coal industry capitalizes upon these feelings by promoting coal heritage-a carefully curated cultural construction that emphasizes selective aspects of Appalachian history while erasing those that challenge its domination. Coal heritage, I show, conveys environmentalism as an attack on Appalachians' right to economic opportunity, their role in the national division of labor, and their moral worth. It frames industry representatives, on the other hand, as guardians of regional interests and values.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spx030"},{"Year":2018,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"The more you have, the more you lose: Criminal justice involvement, ascribed socioeconomic status, and achieved SES","Abstract":"In the present study, we examine the relationship between involvement in the criminal justice system and achieved socioeconomic status (SES), as well as the moderating effect of ascribed SES.

Furthermore, those coming from the highest socioeconomic backgrounds are not \"protected\"from the deleterious consequences of system involvement, but instead experience the greatest declines in achieved SES relative to where they started.

Scholars have outlined a number of ways that nonprofits strategically respond to resource scarcity. Why nonprofits select particular strategies, however, is less clear. This article motivates a network membership perspective via a mixed-methods study of one food bank and its associated food pantries, wherein actors navigate competing network demands that are emblematic of those faced by other nonprofits. Food banks source food from three types of networks-a cartel-like network orchestrated by a national coordinating body, a peer-topeer inter-food bank network, and a bureaucratic network anchored by the USDA-that place overlapping and conflicting constraints on the organizations. In combination, network demands entangle the food banks within a web of tensions that prevent many forms of adaptation while enabling others, a predicament I refer to in this article as network entrapment. How organizations navigate network demands has implications for the vitality of the organizations and the well-being of their beneficiaries. My results suggest that entrapment can lead to organizational burden and the adoption of neoliberal-inspired efficiencies, but also innovations that prioritize citizen rights over cost-benefit ratios.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spw048"},{"Year":2015,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Impossible Burdens: White Institutions, Emotional Labor, and Micro-Resistance","Abstract":"This article explores the connections between white institutional spaces, emotional labor, and resistance by illuminating the shared experiences of people of color in elite law schools and the commercial aviation industry.

In these distinct environments, people of color experience an unequal distribution of emotional labor as a result of negotiating both everyday racial micro-aggressions and dismissive dominant ideologies that deny the relevance of race and racism. As a result they must actively seek ways to engage in forms of resistance that promote counter narratives and protect themselves from denigration while minimizing the risk of severe consequence.

We consider the degree to which both network and cable news media offend viewers in terms of both politics and religion. Using data from the 2010 Baylor Religion Survey, we find that white evangelicals have higher odds than mainline Protestants of reporting taking offense from the evening news, as well as higher odds than religious non-affiliates of being offended by both types of news. The primary divide, however, was between affiliates and non-affiliates, as biblical literalism and religious exclusivism at least partially mediated differences between white evangelicals and mainliners in taking offense from the evening news. Religious service attendance at least partially mediated differences between affiliates and non-affiliates in taking offense from both types of news, but while political conservatism explained differences in being offended by the evening news, it was not a significant predictor of taking offense from cable news. We suggest that this is due to processes of media differentiation that make cable news an equal-opportunity offender.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spy024"},{"Year":2015,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Arab American protest in the terror decade: Macro- and micro-level response to post-9\/11 repression","Abstract":"Arab Americans have borne the greatest brunt of government and non-state repression in the aftermath of the terrorists' attacks on September 11, 2001. In this study, we document how post-9\/11 repression affects Arab American protest at the macro and micro level. Coding articles from the Detroit Free Press (1999-2010), we find at the macro level that Arab American protest in the Detroit area spiked in the aftermath of 9\/11 and that there is a strong temporal relationship between anti-Arab\/Muslim hate crime and protest. At the micro level, results from the Detroit Arab American Study (2003) show that personally experiencing repression enhances protest participation most strongly for those whose Arab identity is not especially salient. We interpret this finding to mean that such individuals experience repression as a moral shock and\/or quotidian disruption and hence such encounters especially motivate them to protest. This is one of the first studies to demonstrate that repression can be especially mobilizing for those who under other circumstances would be least likely to protest. Our study pushes theorizing about repression by highlighting that the state is not the only actor who represses; that repression need not target protestors to affect the possibilities of protest; and that state and non-state repression is often tightly coupled for racial and ethnic minority populations.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spv004"},{"Year":2017,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Racial Discrimination, Racial Socialization, and Crime: Understanding Mechanisms of Resilience","Abstract":"Taking a \"strength approach\" to African American families and cultures, recent research demonstrates that familial racial socialization provides resilience to the criminogenic effects of interpersonal racial discrimination among Black youth. Building on these nascent findings, the present study takes a process-oriented approach to understand how racial socialization reduces and counteracts the effects of discrimination on offending. Building on a social schematic theory of offending (Burt and Simons 2011), this study explores whether two social psychological factors, positive racial identities and spirituality, serve as mechanisms through which racial socialization provides resilience. We test our hypotheses with structural equation models using data from the Family and Community Health Study (FACHS), a longitudinal, multisite study of roughly 700 African American youth and their primary caregivers followed from late childhood to early adulthood. Consistent with our theoretical model, findings suggest that familial racial socialization practices provide resilience to the criminogenic effects of racial discrimination in large part by increasing positive racial identities and spirituality.

To examine this proposition we identify two cohorts of Mexican Americans-those who came of age in the World War II era and those who grew up during and after the Civil Rights movement-and examine whether there are systematic differences in how members of these cohorts interpret immigration issues. In line with our expectations, group consciousness predicts the attitudes of the Civil Rights cohort, but not of those in the World War II cohort. Furthermore, the predictive power of generational status-a centerpiece of assimilation-based analyses of Latinos' immigration attitudes-ceases after the second generation. Together, these findings support our argument that Mexican Americans' position on the immigration debate is not simply a function of varied levels of assimilation or group attachments, but is also shaped by the national ideological context around immigration in the United States. Our work provides the most comprehensive analysis of Mexican Americans' immigration attitudes to date, filling gaps for scholars interested in the effects of assimilation, group consciousness, and temporal effects on Latino public opinion.

To complement this literature, I argue that the intersection between political parties and social movements is also a strong and stable means for activists to influence policy. Using novel microdata on the German antinuclear movement, and particularly its success in influencing the shutdown of nuclear power plants, I demonstrate that movements realize their goals significantly more rapidly when their intersection with political parties increases.

We explore three broad questions related to pay for care work. First, we examine nurturant and reproductive care penalties together to investigate what mechanisms produce the lower wages for these workers. Second, we examine how occupational closure through education credentials and licensing requirements creates varying returns to care work. Finally, we explore the roles of wage equalizing institutions-labor unions and government sector care provision-in reducing wage disparities associated with care work. Using the 1979-2012 waves of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) and fixed-effects regression models, we find that selection on stable factors and human capital differences explain much of the lower wages for reproductive workers, but none of the low wages of nurturant workers. However, compared to non-care workers, college-educated nurturant care workers receive lower returns to work experience, suggesting limitations in how much learning can increase efficiency in care work, given the labor intensive, face-to-face nature of much of it. Occupational closure matters: Care jobs with the highest educational and licensing requirements pay a wage bonus, while less closed care occupations incur a penalty. Wage equalizing institutions have both floor and ceiling effects on care worker wages that mitigate care penalties for selected workers: women reproductive workers and women in low-education\/ high-licensing occupations. More consistently, ceiling effects of these institutions lower the wages of otherwise higher paid care workers: nurturant and high-education\/high licensing occupations.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spy007"},{"Year":2020,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Beyond Neighborhoods: Activity Spaces of Returning Prisoners","Abstract":"Neighborhood and place are key concerns in prisoner reentry and desistance literature.

In one, scholars have theorized that long-term structural changes in the American political and economic landscape may have radically transformed inter-corporate network structures and changed the political orientation of corporate elites. In another, a small group of corporate elites continues to dominate government policy by advocating for class-wide interests through occupying key positions in government and policy planning groups. We offer new evidence of patterns in and predictors of political strategies among the nation\u2019s elite corporate directors. We utilize an original dataset (the Longitudinal Elite Contributor Database) linked with registries of corporate directors and their board memberships. We ask: (1) has the political activity, unity, or pragmatism of the corporate elite declined since 1982; and (2) are individuals who direct multiple firms more pragmatic in their political action? Evidence suggests that corporate elites are more politically active and unified, and continue to exercise pragmatic political strategies vis-\u00e0-vis their campaign donations. Using random- and fixed-effects models, we present evidence to suggest that becoming a member of the inner circle has a significant moderating effect on elite political behavior.

Drawing on in-depth qualitative interviews with 194 lower-income household heads, we show that debt management strategies are influenced by a desire to promote a financially responsible, self-sufficient social identity. Families are reluctant to ask for assistance when faced with economic hardship because it undermines this identity. Because the need to pay on debts is less acute than the need to pay for regular monthly expenses like rent or groceries, debts receive a lower priority in the monthly budget and families typically juggle their debts in private rather than turning to social networks for assistance. In some cases, however, debts take on special meanings and are handled differently. Respondents prioritize debts when they perceive payment as affirming a self-sufficient or upwardly mobile identity, but they reject and ignore debts they view as unfair or unjust. Because the private coping strategies families employ trap them in costly cycles of indebtedness and hinder future mobility prospects, debt management strategies are consequential for long-term financial well-being.","DOI":"10.1525\/sp.2013.11262"},{"Year":2019,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"The social context of criminal threat, victim race, and punitive black and latino sentiment","Abstract":"A well-established body of research focuses on the relationship between criminal threat and the exercise of formal social control, and a largely separate literature examines the effects of victim race in criminal punishment.

In this article, we address this issue by examining relationships among criminal threat, victim race, and punitive sentiment toward black and Latino defendants. We analyze nationally representative survey data that include both subjective and objective measures of criminal threat, and we incorporate unique information on victim\/offender dyads to test research questions about the that role victim race plays in the formation of anti-black and anti-Latino sentiment in the criminal justice system. The results indicate that both subjective perceptions of criminal threat and minority population growth are significantly related to punitiveness among whites, and that punitive sentiment is enhanced in situations that involve minority offenders and white victims. Moreover, we show that aggregate indicators of racial threat strongly condition the effect of victim race on punitive attitudes.

Children broker in order to compensate for the limited (or nonexistent) accommodations available to their immigrant families when they interact with health-care providers and institutions. As such, children's brokering constitutes an important, often overlooked, linkage between research on immigrant family dynamics and immigrants' interactions with host country institutions. Children's brokering also has implications for their own social, moral, and educational trajectories, which are deeply influenced by their responsibilities to their families. Data collected through field observations and interviews with Latino immigrant parents, their child brokers, and local health-care providers revealed how children's brokering influences these interactions.

Using nationally representative panel data measured before, during, and after the spill I find that rather than giving time and money to actual relief efforts, Americans responded primarily through dramatic increases in time and money given for environmental causes. This expands current understandings about how and why Americans respond to large-scale catastrophe. I argue that this phenomenon can be made sense of theoretically by focusing on the cultural context of \"moral shock\" precipitated by historic environmental harm and corporate negligence, both of which were amplified in the wake of the spill by national media. This heightened emotional climate interacted with Americans' empathetic identities, practices and habits, politics, and culture to produce different pathways to philanthropic engagement. Consistent with this argument, the results show that all four of these factors mattered for predicting generous behavior in this case, but did so at different points in time. I close by outlining the substantive and theoretical implications of my argument.","DOI":"10.1525\/sp.2014.12163"},{"Year":2015,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Restricted movement: Nativity, citizenship, legal status, and the residential crowding of Latinos in Los Angeles","Abstract":"Residential crowding is linked with the well-being of children and adults. Although extensive U.S. research indicates variation in crowding by race\/ethnicity and nativity, far less work investigates differences in crowding by immigrants' citizenship and legal status. Data from the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey (L.A.FANS) are used to focus on Latinos, the group most likely to experience crowding in the United States. The analyses examine heterogeneity in crowding among four distinct groups of Latinos: U.S.-born naturalized citizens, authorized noncitizen immigrants, and unauthorized noncitizen immigrants. Theories of locational attainment and immigrant assimilation are used to develop hypotheses about whether intra-Latino variation in crowding is explained by differences in individual, household, and other characteristics, and which structural factors also interfere in this process. Multivariate analyses indicate that neither nativity nor citizenship status are linked with residential crowding, net of other variables. In contrast, lacking legal status does have residual impacts on the outcome: unauthorized noncitizen immigrants are more crowded than authorized noncitizens and all other groups. The results offer support for the spatial assimilation and place stratification perspectives on locational attainment. These findings contribute to emerging scholarship documenting the unique structural challenges that unauthorized Latino immigrants experience in residential outcomes and other domains in the United States.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spu007"},{"Year":2019,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Inequality in infant mortality: Cross-state variation and medical system institutions","Abstract":"This article examines variation in the association between maternal education and infant mortality across the 50 U.S. states.

In some states, infants born to mothers with less than 12 years of schooling are more than twice as likely to die as infants of mothers with 4 years of college or more. Other states see far more equality between these groups. I then evaluate two components of state medical systems that are predicted to be associated with this variation in the magnitude of inequalities in infant mortality: neonatal intensive care units and primary care physician supply. More widespread availability of neonatal intensive care is associated with reduced inequalities in infant mortality. In contrast, the supply of primary care is linked to slightly larger differences in infant mortality between mothers with low and high education.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spx034"},{"Year":2016,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Moral panic, moral breach: Bernhard goetz, george zimmerman, and racialized news reporting in contested cases of self-defense","Abstract":"This article examines local news coverage of two landmark self-defense shooting cases-The 1984 Bernhard Goetz case and the 2012 George Zimmerman case-To interrogate the racialized construction of crime and, specifically, extend moral panic theory to the contemporary context of racial colorblindness. Analyzing 542 local news stories, I find the Goetz case was framed as a moral panic, while Zimmerman coverage exhibited a moral breach. The Zimmercan case: (1) is characterized by competing, rather than complementary, narratives; (2) reframes \"folk devils\" as victims and disrupts clear-cut allocations of blame; (3) emphasizes harm to communities rather than harm to social order; and (4) elicits calls for dialogue and acknowledgement rather than collective punishment and shaming. Unpacking what the different styles of narrative mean for racialized constructions of victims and criminals and the social construction of harm, threat, and social action, I argue that, despite the greater attention to race found in Zimmerman coverage, moral breaches tend to compartmentalize social problems and thus narrow their impact.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spv029"},{"Year":2018,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Identity of distance: How economically marginalized black and Latina women navigate risk discourse and employ feminist ideals","Abstract":"Racialized and classed \u201crisk\u201d narratives of sexuality in the United States construct economically marginalized young women of color as sexually precocious, potential teen mothers who are likely to end up as burdens on the state.

Fewer studies analyze how young women who are not pregnant or parenting produce, reproduce, and challenge dominant risk narratives about their sexuality. Drawing on three years of intensive fieldwork among 13 young economically marginalized black and Latina women, I demonstrate how feminist ideologies of empowerment interact with pervasive risk narratives in the everyday lives of marginalized women coming of age in the \u201cshadow of the women\u2019s movement.\u201d My observations show that the young women strategically navigate circulating risk narratives about their sexuality by constructing an identity of distance characterized by feminist ideals of independence, self-respect, and self-development to distance themselves from these narratives. However, as they construct this identity of distance, they also stigmatize young mothers and police their own bodies and the bodies of their friends and sisters.

First, explanations of beliefs about antipoverty efforts largely focus on current contexts. By emphasizing contemporary contexts, existing research overlooks the potentially profound effect of past experiences. Second, most existing research relies on cross-sectional data, which limits understandings of within person change. In the research presented here, I use both cross-sectional and panel data from the General Social Survey to (1) examine how past experiences shape an individual's belief about what the government should do about poverty and (2) examine whether beliefs about the government's role in helping the poor are sensitive to changes in micro and macro-economic hardship. Drawing on theories related to the formative years and event driven changes, I find that experiences during late adolescence, increases in macro-level economic hardship, and increases in individual hardship all influence support for government efforts to lessen poverty; however, current objective and subjective economic position is particularly important. Moreover, I find variation in support across different types of government responses to poverty. In particular, welfare is uniquely unpopular, and support for welfare is less responsive to generational experiences or changes in individual level hardship.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spw008"},{"Year":2015,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Ecological Losses are Harming Women: A Structural Analysis of Female HIV Prevalence and Life Expectancy in Less Developed Countries","Abstract":"Increased inequality in life expectancies across nations due to the advent of the HIV pandemic requires rigorous investigation of gender inequalities, as women now disproportionally represent the majority of global HIV cases.

We fill this gap by integrating ecofeminist perspectives to inform our analysis of the direct and indirect effects of ecological losses on female health outcomes in a structural equation model of 136 less developed nations.

To address these questions this paper examines renewable energy policy adoption by U.S. states and argues that states adopt policies of different types based on their state-level economic, political, institutional, and cultural characteristics. I test these claims by examining the tax incentive- and regulatory mandate-based policy instruments adopted to promote renewable energy generation by U.S. states over a forty-year period. Using random effects Poisson regression analysis, I find that state affluence, environmental movement organization density, and fossil fuel production predict the number of policies a state is likely to adopt, while an affinity for a neo-liberal ideology and prior policy actions predict the types of policies a state adopts. These results reinforce perceptions of economic factors as key predictors of renewable energy policy, but also highlight the importance of less frequently examined cultural factors for explaining a state's portfolio of policies. More broadly, this analysis offers a more robust picture of the relationship between tax incentive and regulatory mandates, the two types of programmatic approaches that have dominated many policy domains in the United States over the past forty years.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spw007"},{"Year":2018,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Criminalized masculinities: How policing shapes the construction of gender and sexuality in poor black communities","Abstract":"With the intensification of policing and criminalization over the last three decades, residents of impoverished black communities are increasingly subject to street-level criminalization. This article examines how policing shapes the construction of gender and sexuality among its (potential) targets. Drawing on 12 months of fieldwork and interviews with 60 black youth living on Chicago's South Side, we find that in order to reduce the probability of a stop-and-frisk, young black men engage in reflexive and embodied masculinity performances. Aware that officers are most likely to detain and interrogate individuals who outwardly display toughness, emotional restrictiveness, and a proclivity for violence associated with the \"cool pose\"and the \"code of the street,\"youth attempt to communicate their innocence by exaggerating displays of emotional sensitivity, caring, vulnerability, and passivity. They concretely do so by overemphasizing (and even feigning) romantic involvement in heterosexual relationships-a strategy they refer to as \"getting cover.\"Although \"doing masculinity\"in this manner may assist black youth in avoiding criminalization, it privileges dominant, mainstream (and often-unattainable) expressions of gender and sexuality while reinforcing hegemonic masculinity and heteronormativity.

Drawing on theories of gender and status, I predict gender differences in responses to-and behavior in-subordinate roles. In a series of experimental studies I find that men are more publicly critical of leaders and more willing to undermine leaders than are women. In two studies I find that men are more publicly critical in both high and low status subordinate roles, and under both men and women leaders. In a third study, I find that men and women do not differ in their private behavior or evaluations of a leader and that gender differences in subordinate behavior and evaluations only arise in publicly visible evaluations, behavior, and criticism. Gender differences in public behavior and evaluation may be due to men exaggerating their criticism to restore a threatened sense of status or masculinity, or due to women tempering their criticism due to gender stereotypes that discourage assertive and critical behavior for women. Either explanation suggests that men and women perform gendered expectations in public and behave in ways that can disadvantage women leaders.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spx032"},{"Year":2019,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Categorical exclusions: How racialized gender regulation reproduces reentry hardship","Abstract":"Since gender organizes key reentry services such as housing, formerly incarcerated people seeking resources must successfully inhabit a gender category. Drawing on seven months of ethnography and 79 interviews with service providers and formerly incarcerated transgender people, I show that these organizational practices of gender categorization are racialized and impact resource access. Most gender-segregated housing programs rely on biology-based definitions of gender. These gender rules create workable options for trans men to stay with women, but bar trans women from women\u2019s spaces. Once in gendered housing programs, clients need to navigate gender assessment in interactions. Trans men employed several strategies to establish gendered selves who were easily categorized as either male or female, which allowed them to access stable housing. Gender sanctioning posed a major problem for black trans women. Black trans women were highly scrutinized in women\u2019s programs, characterized as illegitimate based on biological definitions of gender, and harassed for any perceived deviation from gender norms. When harassment escalated into conflict, they were expelled from programs. Regulation of black trans women\u2019s womanhood led to systematic material deprivation.

Most accounts see these cross-field dynamics as exogenous events, granting movements little control over when and how these opportunities might emerge. In contrast, this article argues that activists can and do purposely create cross-field effects. Examining changes in contentious practice in the American labor movement-which in recent decades, has reoriented contention over workplace issues away from workplaces themselves, and toward political arenas more traditionally dominated by community concerns-this article advances the concept of cross-field manipulation, purposive strategic action that accounts for the positioning of actors across social fields, triggering events in one field so as to reorder the dynamics of another. Using a historical study of evolving organizing practices in a Southern California hotel workers' union, including interviews and archival sources, the paper identifies three mechanisms-power analysis, alliance building, and actor-triggered crises-whereby labor activists purposely generate cross-field effects. Through repeated interactions with employers and polities, activists learned a unique campaign model that politicized workplace conflict in communities and markets, generating opportunities for workplace gains.

However, the impact that identities socialized in the prison may have outside of the institution itself remains an under-researched aspect of mass incarceration's collateral consequences. In this article I use ethnographic data collected over fifteen months in two juvenile justice facilities and interviews with twenty-four probation youth to examine how the identities socialized among Latino prison inmates spill over into high-incarceration Latina\/o neighborhoods. Strict segregation practices in California's prison system categorize and separate Latino inmates as coming from either Northern, Southern, or Central California, respectively institutionalizing Norte\u00f1o, Sure\u00f1o, and Bulldog collective identities in the process. I argue that these identities have come to frame how criminalized Latina\/o youth understand the prison's influence on their community. As youth enter the juvenile justice system, they encounter facilities that have appropriated the prison's sorting practices by categorizing youth and policing the boundaries between them. Carceral group identities become instrumental in young people's daily lives in this context, mirroring what they have heard from the experiences of incarcerated loved ones and confirming where they would fit in the prison's social order. This process not only labels youth as gang members, but instills in them identities and worldviews that rationalize their own incarceration, extending the prison's ability to categorize people as carceral subjects far beyond the penitentiary gates.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spw001"},{"Year":2019,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Veiled threats: Color-blind frames and group threat in affirmative action discourse","Abstract":"This research examines the way color-blind rhetorical techniques are used by supporters and opponents in legal documents submitted to the latest U.S. Supreme court case on affirmative action.

One major theme emerged: highly involved white members described their close friends of color in utilitarian terms and not integrated into daily activities outside of the interracial organization. This theme, named the \u201cone friend rule,\u201d is a micro-level mechanism where whites mobilize a \u201cclose\u201d interracial tie to project a generalized value for diversity while simultaneously limiting access to personal resources.

I apply this argument to two relevant types of institutionally defined social capital: Ethnic and religious. In the case of ethnic social capital, I find that ethnic church attendance amplified Hispanic national origin differences in protest rates in a manner consistent with differential treatment under U.S. immigration policy. In the case of religious social capital, I find that active religious involvement only increased the likelihood of protest when churches institutionally supported protest. Together, these findings suggest that a key mechanism linking nonpolitical organizations to protest is their ability to define and direct collective interest through institutional practices.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spv023"},{"Year":2015,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"The best laid plans: Social capital in the development of girls' educational and occupational plans","Abstract":"This study examines social class and race differences in young women's social capital for the development of educational and occupational plans.

These narratives posit teen childbearing as an unequivocal social, health, and economic problem, although some scholars and policy makers construct alternative narratives that focus on inequalities and propose different perspectives on causes and consequences. Narrative inquiry that analyzes how stories are produced and utilized can enable a more nuanced approach to complex social problems. We conducted 19 individual, in-depth, and semistructured interviews with young mothers ages 16 to 21 who attend a community-based alternative education program in a low-income northeastern city. Interviews were analyzed using thematic narrative techniques. The young mothers we interviewed used a process of strategic negotiation to distance themselves from prevailing social and cultural stories about the problem of teen motherhood. Participants demonstrated this strategic process through their attempts to assuage stigma and construct unproblematic identities. Young mothers reproduced and reinterpreted a variety of circulating narratives on teen childbearing. They reproduced dominant narratives through pathology, missed adolescence, and redemption stories, and reinterpreted dominant narratives through stories of stratified reproduction, sexual health education, and stigmatization and surveillance. Our participants' narratives illustrate the need to think broadly about the meanings of early pregnancy and motherhood in terms of how they play out in research and policymaking.

In the hills west of Bethlehem, Palestinian villagers confront colonial violence by Israeli settlers and the state. They also confront a crisis of unemployment and rapid urbanization due to neoliberal restructuring. These dynamics have combined to create an indirect form of displacement and a market-based strategy of colonization.

Using data from the 2014 Child Development Supplement (CDS) of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), I assess whether unsecured debt, by amount and type of debt, is associated with food insecurity among lower-income households with children (N\u00bc1,319). Results indicate that medical debt increases odds of household food insecurity even after accounting for key sociodemographic and economic risk factors, while no relationship exists between other forms of unsecured debt and food insecurity. Moreover, although liquid assets decrease the risk of household food insecurity and attenuate the harmful effects associated with unpaid medical bills, few households have enough liquid assets to mitigate the risks associated with medical debt.

I show how multiple shifting sources of legitimacy allowed the PKK to be perceived as illegitimate by various audiences without compromising their capacity for resilience and success as they retained support within a broadly legitimated movement for Kurdish rights in Turkey. This research offers broad new insights into the cumulative effects of multiple sources of legitimacy, the relationality of legitimacy, and the benefits of illegitimacy.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spv006"},{"Year":2014,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"The earnings of less educated asian american men: Educational selectivity and the model minority image","Abstract":"Asian Americans have long been popularly portrayed as a \"model minority\" that has achieved approximate labor market parity with whites. However, this characterization has been alternatively described as \"a destructive myth,\" especially for those who do not have high levels of education. Our analysis focuses on less educated Asian Americans who may be particularly neglected in the labor market because of their incongruence with the model minority image. Consistent with this focus, we specify quantile regression models that estimate net racial effects at both the lower and the higher ends of the distribution of earnings. The results indicate that Asian American men who drop out of high school earn substantially less than comparable whites at the low end of the earnings distribution. This pattern of racial differentials seems to be consistent with the \"destructive myth\" perspective and inconsistent with the alternative explanation of negative educational selectivity. In general, our findings illustrate the fruitfulness of Kevin Leicht's (2008) proposed research agenda of studying racial disadvantage by disaggregated class-related groupings and across the entire distribution of earnings rather than focusing exclusively on one overall racial differential that is assessed as a conditional mean.

Yet, it remains unclear how the law actually functions, particularly how it has been used in response to gender disparities in higher education. This article provides the first systematic analysis of how Title IX has been mobilized at the postsecondary level. Drawing on new data acquired through seven Freedom of Information Act requests, I analyze all resolved Title IX complaints filed with the Office for Civil Rights against four-year nonprofit colleges and universities from 1994 to 2014. I find that the mobilization of Title IX has changed both in frequency and in kind during this period. Filings started to rise after 2000 and exploded after 2009, while sexual harassment complaints nearly equaled academic and athletic filings for the first time in 2014. Private, more selective institutions as well as schools located in states with more women serving in state legislatures face a disproportionate number of complaints relative to enrollment, indicating the importance of institutional context to legal mobilization.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spy005"},{"Year":2019,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"The Political Incorporation of Undocumented Youth","Abstract":"This article develops and empirically tests a model of political incorporation for undocumented youth in the United States, focusing on nonvoting forms of political engagement. Using one of the \ufb01rst nationwide surveys of undocumented millennials between the ages of 18 and 35 (n = 1,472), we show that (1) undocumented youth express much higher levels of political efficacy and participation than the literature on immigrant political incorporation leads us to expect, (2) membership in organizations that work on immigration-related issues is a main determinant of this sense of political efficacy, and (3) through mediation analysis, that organizational membership (the mediator) in\ufb02uences how political efficacy affects political participation, and not the other way around. The literature on immigrant political incorporation is vast, but precedent studies too often focus on formal acts of political participation, such as naturalization and voting, by those with lawful immigration status. With an analytical focus on youth without lawful immigration status, this article contributes to theoretical and empirical knowledge about how and to what extent undocumented youth become politically active and engaged despite the many obstacles that exist to their formal participation in politics.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spy009"},{"Year":2020,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"As goes the city? Older Americans' home upkeep in the aftermath of the great recession","Abstract":"The private home is a crucial site in the aging process, yet the upkeep of this physical space often poses a challenge for community-dwelling older adults. Previous efforts to explain variation in disorderly household conditions have relied on individual-level characteristics, but ecological perspectives propose that home environments are inescapably nested within the dynamic socioeconomic circumstances of surrounding spatial contexts, such as the metro area. We address this ecological embeddedness in the context of the Great Recession, an event in which some U.S. cities saw pronounced and persistent declines across multiple economic indicators while other areas rebounded more rapidly. Panel data (2005-6 and 2010-11) from a national survey of older adults were linked to interviewer home evaluations and city-level economic data. Results from fixed-effects regression support the hypothesis that older adults dwelling in struggling cities experienced an uptick in disorderly household conditions. Findings emphasize the importance of city-specificity when probing effects of a downturn. Observing changes in home upkeep also underscores the myriad ways in which a city's most vulnerable residents- older adults, in particular- are affected by its economic fortunes.","DOI":"10.1093\/SOCPRO\/SPZ022"},{"Year":2020,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Sexual laborers and entrepreneurial women: Articulating collective identity in India\u2019s HIV\/AIDS response","Abstract":"This article uses ethnographic and interview methods to compare two groups of sex workers in Bangalore, both of which formed during the response to the HIV\/AIDS epidemic.

Instead, I show how collective identity is articulated, in a locally specific process of relating political orientations to local associational fields, within, but not predetermined by, global funding constraints. As each group positioned itself in a distinct local associational field, it articulated a distinct collective identity, the Women\u2019s Collective as entrepreneurial women (a more respectable collective identity), and the Union as sexual laborers (a more transgressive one).

We extend understanding of this stigma and its effects by demonstrating how stigma operates as a mechanism of social control at both interactional and structural levels to preserve the moral order. We also further general stigma theory by clarifying the conceptualization of power that befits understanding stigma as a mechanism of social control that has cognitive, interpersonal, structural, and moral components. Analysis of data from 6 focus groups with women survivors of intimate partner violence and 19 interviews with close others and key informants in Kenya shows that the moral order, or what matters most, is maintenance of the marital unit, to a great degree because it is the institution that maintains the economic survival of women and children. The cultural belief that a woman experiencing spousal abuse has violated normative gender and spousal expectations and is therefore a threat to the moral order of the community demands that both husbands and community members act to protect the moral order. Protection of the moral order is accomplished through discrimination against survivors that is institutionalized through custom, law, and the family. Thus stigma acts as a, albeit contested, community process of social control that (re)produces gendered power geographies.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spw012"},{"Year":2017,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Crime and legal work: A markovian model of the desistance process","Abstract":"Over the past two decades, two dominant themes have emerged in the study of desistance from crime: desistance is a gradual process, and embedded in the desistance process are important life events or turning points. Yet sociological and criminological empirical studies of desistance tend to focus on these two processes separately. Using a panel of serious offenders, we examine the progression over age of the probability of participation in legal employment and offending, and consider how past participation in one regime is associated with the decision to remain in or switch regimes. We model desistance from crime as a discrete-time Markovian process, which allows us to trace the process of desistance prospectively and to embed within it participation in legal work or not. We find that the conditional probabilities of being in certain states (e.g., legal employment, crime) are heavily dependent on one's prior state. Furthermore, we find that this process has inertia-or memory-in that the probability of legal employment increases and the probability of crime decreases, based on accumulated legal employment.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spw027"},{"Year":2018,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Segmented re\/integration: Divergent post-deportation trajectories in El Salvador","Abstract":"This study extends segmented assimilation to post-deportation studies. Drawing from life history interviews with 96 deported Salvadoran men, it argues that deportees follow different paths to re\/integration upon return. Divergent trajectories are explained by an interaction between the context of return (government policies, social reception, economic structure, and the deportee community), migrant characteristics (demographics, criminal and migratory histories, economic resources, and social ties), and agentic behavior. In El Salvador, national affiliations and perceptions of deportee criminality emerge as the best predictors of post-deportation outcomes. Deportees who grew up in El Salvador and remained connected to it while abroad (Salvadoran Nationals) encountered a relatively more favorable societal reception but faced a precarious economic situation. Conversely, deportees who spent significant time in the U.S. and continued identified with it prior to removal (U.S. Nationals) were highly stigmatized and criminalized upon return. U.S. nationals struggled to find employment and were targeted by police and gangs. Regardless of sociocultural and economic outcomes, both Salvadoran nationals and U.S. nationals longed to return to the U.S., especially if they had children abroad. The study affirms existing research claiming that mass deportation may slow but does not stop the migration cycle in the Americas. It also offers an analytical framework for future comparative post-deportation research.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spw049"},{"Year":2014,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Does segregation create winners and losers? Residential segregation and inequality in educational attainment","Abstract":"This article examines the effects of residential segregation on the basis of poverty status and race for high school and college completion. Segregation effects are estimated by contrasting educational outcomes among persons raised in metropolitan areas with varying levels of segregation. This metropolitan-level approach provides two advantages in evaluating segregation effects over neighborhood effects studies: it incorporates effects of residential segregation outside of the affected individuals' neighborhoods of residence and it allows evaluation of gains and losses across groups from segregation. Data are drawn from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and the decennial censuses. Poor-nonpoor segregation is associated with lower rates of high school graduation among adolescents from poor backgrounds, but has no effect on rates of graduation for students from nonpoor backgrounds. Black-white segregation is associated with lower rates of high school graduation and college graduation for black students, but has no effect on graduation rates for white students. Use of proximity-adjusted segregation measures or instrumental variable estimation gives similar results. The results suggest that residential segregation harms the educational attainment of disadvantaged groups without increasing the educational attainment of advantaged groups.","DOI":"10.1525\/sp.2014.12193"},{"Year":2018,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Marching toward assimilation?

I test the hypothesis, dominant in the existing literature, that major sociopolitical events raise ethnic consciousness and lead to reactive or retentionist attitudes that privilege maintenance of ethnic culture over \"blending in.\" Contrary to established findings, I show that the marches did not increase retentionist attitudes nor strengthen ethnic nationalism. Instead, in the period during and after the marches, Mexican immigrants were more likely to hold incorporationist attitudes that place value on both assimilation and ethnic cultural maintenance, as well as assimilationist attitudes which privilege \"blending in\" to American society. These findings suggest that attitudes were influenced by the incorporationist and assimilationist messages promulgated by protest organizers and the Spanish-language media. The specific discourse used by media and activists can shape both individual attitudes and conceptions of how minority groups relate to wider society, evincing a more expansive approach to American identity.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spw051"},{"Year":2015,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Diagnostic domain defense: Autism spectrum disorder and the DSM-5","Abstract":"A central mechanism by which medicalization occurs is through domain expansion, wherein an existing diagnostic definition widens to include cases beyond its original scope. This has been especially commonplace with respect to mental illness diagnoses. In contrast, there are few clear instances of domain contraction. The controversy surrounding the revisions to autism in advance of the publication of the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) is thus of considerable importance. Many autism advocates feared the new definition of autism would exclude a significant number of individuals who are already diagnosed. We examine lay claims making to this perceived instance of domain contraction through a content analysis of online reader comments to a high-profile New York Times article reporting on the DSM-5 autism criteria. Our analysis points to an amorphous group of social stakeholders who express a variety of concerns about unabated medicalization. We also identify the stance of diagnostic domain defense, which is an oppositional response by laypeople with a personal connection to a diagnosis to a real or perceived challenge to the definitional boundaries of that diagnosis. Our analysis explicates the dimensions of diagnostic domain defense, which include its grounding in experiential certainty and anguish, and the accrual and deployment of diagnostic resources. We make a case for the utility of this concept for theorizing the relationship between lay claims making, diagnoses, and medicalization. We also make a case for the use of online reader comments as a way to unobtrusively study lay claims making related to pressing social problems in the Internet era.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spu001"},{"Year":2016,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Prisoner Reentry and the Reproduction of Legal Cynicism","Abstract":"More than 600,000 prisoners are released from incarceration each year in the United States, and most end up returning to metropolitan areas, concentrated in resource-deprived neighborhoods. To the extent that convicted criminals are distrustful of the criminal justice system, the funneling of massive numbers of former prisoners back into select neighborhoods likely facilitates the reproduction of legal cynicism in those areas. Accordingly, this study tests the effect of prisoner reentry on the culture of neighborhoods, particularly with regard to legal cynicism. Using two-waves of data on the geographic distribution of returning prisoners in Chicago from the Illinois Department of Corrections combined with data on neighborhood characteristics from the U.S. Census, the Chicago Police Department, the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods, and the Chicago Community Adult Health Study, I conduct a cross-lagged analysis of the effect of the concentration of returning prisoners on legal cynicism as well as the effect of legal cynicism on the geographic distribution of returning prisoners. Findings reveal that a dense concentration of returning prisoners in a neighborhood facilitates the reproduction of cynical views of the law in the neighborhood. The substantial growth in the number of releases from prison and the stark concentration of the formerly incarcerated in select neighborhoods has detrimental consequences for the culture of receiving neighborhoods.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spw003"},{"Year":2014,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Are contemporary patterns of black male joblessness unique? Cohort replacement, intracohort change, and the diverging structures of black and white men's employment","Abstract":"Employment rates for black men have declined sharply over the last half century. We use data from the 1962-2009 March Current Population Surveys and linear decomposition techniques to examine the mechanisms generating change in employment rates for white and black men with different levels of education. We find that not only did the overall magnitude of change in employment differ by race and education, but so too did the mechanisms generating change. Black men with less than a college degree experienced sharper declines in employment than did white men and more educated blackmen. Cohort replacement processes played amore prominent role in employment declines for less educated black men than for other men, who were affected more strongly by intracohort change mechanisms. Stronger cohort replacement effects for less educated black men concentrated joblessness to an unparalleled extent among younger black men with the least formal schooling. Declining employment since the 1960s for this group of men was not primarily the result of economic downturns or layoffs later in life, but rather resulted from the inability of more recent cohorts to secure stable employment. Comparisons of the employment experiences of less educated blackmen in the metropolises experiencing the most deindustrialization to those of men in other areas reveal that these men experienced greater employment declines not only because more recent cohorts had greater difficulty securing stable employment in early adulthood but also because, within cohorts, they experienced additional job losses associated with aging and changes in the economy.

Lack of ontological security is at the core of emotions they must contend with, from frustration, fear, shame, and depression to anxiety about their future. Positive coping strategies include individually oriented activities such as listening to music, exercising, playing sports, attending church, and turning to close family members or friends for advice or compassion. Negative coping strategies often include behaviors that result in self-harm, including starving themselves, overeating, drinking, smoking, using drugs, and even ideating or attempting suicide. The most positive mechanism to foster well-being draws from social and emotional health generated by membership in immigrant advocacy organizations that provide opportunities for empowerment and belonging. Meaningful social connections result in positive emotional states, which in turn, provide young immigrants with emotional capital to aid in the process of resocialization, leading them to recast negative emotions into positive ones. We conclude with a discussion of conditions most conducive to the emotional well-being of undocumented immigrant young adults and factors that enhance emotional capital and contribute to greater well-being among this population.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spx010"},{"Year":2018,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Money, morals, and condom use: The politics of health in gay and straight adult film production","Abstract":"This paper compares condom use between the gay and straight California adult film industries and examines the culturally embedded decision making processes that affect the use of condoms in adult films. Drawing on in-depth interviews with people in the adult film industry, I argue that those within the gay and straight adult film industries utilize condoms and HIV testing as strategic actions motivated by two separate institutional logics. Within the straight industry, I find that a logic of profit maximization motivates HIV testing with the effect of identifying and quarantining HIV positive performers. Those within the straight industry then strategically justify non-condom use stating condoms are painful and condom use is an issue of performer's choice. Within the gay adult film industry, I find that a logic of civil rights and solidarity motivates condom use by implicitly avoiding identifying and stigmatizing HIV positive performers through mandated HIV tests. Ironically, performers in the gay adult film industry also strategically use condoms to manage their reputations and stigma by signaling to consumers that they are not HIV positive. In sum, these findings highlight the important ways people strategically rationalize and justify organizational health policies and practices while motivated by shared cultural schemas.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spw046"},{"Year":2017,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"After the meltdown: Explaining the silence of Japanese environmental organizations on the Fukushima Nuclear Crisis","Abstract":"Since the Kyoto Protocol, and prior to the Fukushima Daiichi meltdown in 2011, a nuclear safety discourse bolstered the industry and supported its promise to meet energy demands while mitigating the risks of global warming. The Fukushima nuclear disaster and humanitarian crisis caused by the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami in 2011 called the entire nuclear industry into question. However, the silence among established environmental organizations continued. Based on an extensive study of Japanese environmental organizations, we investigate why Japanese environmental organizations were relatively silent on one of the largest environmental crises in the country's history. We address this question historically and quantitatively, incorporating survey data on a national sample of Japanese environmental organizations. This research also quantitatively operationalizes the effects of board of director composition on the behavior of a subsample of environmental organizations (EOs). The statistical analyses show that environmental groups with government and corporate board members are significantly less likely to publicly denounce nuclear energy following the Fukushima meltdown. The political-organizational embeddedness of these EOs are illustrated with a network heuristic of overlapping industry, government, and environmental organizations.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spw034"},{"Year":2019,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Within-Neighborhood Dynamics: Disadvantage, Collective Efficacy, and Homicide Rates in Chicago","Abstract":"Research on neighborhood structural conditions like concentrated disadvantage and crime largely focuses on between-neighborhood differences; for example, places with more disadvantage are expected to experience higher homicide rates. However, empirical research often does not consider within-neighborhood dynamics of structural stability and change. Furthermore, several recent studies have found cross-sectional associations between structural variables and crime outcomes can vary significantly across units, violating a key assumption of global modeling strategies. The current work explores if and how historical changes in disadvantage influence neighborhood collective efficacy and homicide rates, net of the level of disadvantage at a given time point. Collective efficacy theoretically mediates the relationship between conditions and crime, and is hypothesized to be the mechanism through which structural change influences homicide rates. It is also hypothesized that spatial variation in cross-sectional associations between disadvantage and social outcomes can be explained by accounting for within-neighborhood changes in disadvantage. Using a sample of Chicago neighborhoods and ordinary least squares and geographically weighted regression models, I find that within-neighborhood changes in disadvantage significantly predict neighborhood collective efficacy, though the effects of this change on homicide rates are not completely mediated by collective efficacy. Within-neighborhood change completely accounts for spatial variation in cross-sectional associations, offering one explanation of prior research findings. Within-neighborhood structural changes appear to disrupt collective efficacy and contribute to higher homicide rates than predicted by the level of disadvantage alone.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spy013"},{"Year":2014,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Family socioeconomic status, peers, and the path to college","Abstract":"Drawing on the primary\/secondary effects perspective of educational inequality, this mixed methods study investigated connections between high school students' trajectories through college preparatory course work and their relationships with parents and peers as a channel in the intergenerational transmission of socioeconomic inequality.

During this starting period of high school, exposure to school-based peer groups characterized by higher levels of parent education appeared to amplify these course work disparities between students with and without college-educated parents. Ethnographic data from a single high school pointed to possible mechanisms for these patterns, including the tendency for students with college-educated parents to have more information about the relative weight of grades, core courses, and electives in college going and for academically relevant information from school peers with college-educated parents to matter most to students' course work when it matched what was coming from their own parents.","DOI":"10.1525\/sp.2014.12255"},{"Year":2020,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Code of the tweet: Urban gang violence in the social media age","Abstract":"Academics, criminal justice professionals, and news outlets have warned that gang-associated youth use social media to taunt rivals and trade insults in ways that cause offline retaliation.

Extensive information was obtained via interviews with proxy informants living in the same household as cases and controls. Each measure of hazardous drinking was associated with increased risk of violent death, and nearly 60 percent of homicides were attributable to hazardous drinking.

Specifically, men's current economic standing and men's future economic security have been shown to affect their marriageability. Traditionally, labor unions provided economic standing and security to male workers. Yet during the same period that marriage has declined among young people, membership in labor unions has declined precipitously, particularly for men. In this article, we examine the relationship between union membership and first marriage and discuss the possible mechanisms by which union membership might lead to first marriage. We draw on longitudinal data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth-79 to estimate discrete time event-history models of first marriage entry and find that, controlling for many factors, union membership is positively and significantly associated with marriage.We show then that this relationship is largely explained by the increased income, regularity and stability of employment, and fringe benefits that come with union membership.","DOI":"10.1525\/sp.2014.12316"},{"Year":2018,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Agency and resilience along the Arizona-Sonora border: How unauthorized migrants become aware of and resist contemporary U.S. nativist mobilization","Abstract":"Little is known about the extra-political consequences of contemporary U.S.-based nativist mobilization as well as the resilience unauthorized migrants display in the face of anti-immigrant mobilization along the U.S.-Mexico border.

In so doing, we examine: (1) factors influencing repatriated unauthorized migrants\u2019 awareness of nativist mobilization (i.e., Minutemen) along the Arizona-Sonora border, and (2) factors explaining why some migrants would or would not be potentially deterred from attempting future unauthorized crossings if encountering the Minutemen were a possibility.

We also uncover an interesting paradox: migrants traveling with coyotes were less likely to have heard of Minutemen and more likely to be potentially deterred. Collectively, our results provide insight into the overlooked extra-political consequences of contemporary U.S. nativist mobilization, how resiliency in the face of such a deterrent is structured among repatriated unauthorized migrants, and how seemingly powerless migrant groups can mitigate potential threats initiated by relatively privileged groups of U.S. citizens.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spx028"},{"Year":2015,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"The social context of latino threat and punitive latino sentiment","Abstract":"Prior research on the racial threat perspective and social control typically relies on aggregate-level demographic measures and focuses on racial, rather than on Latino group, composition.

The interplay of worker characteristics and organizational policy in shaping unequal responses to a standardized decision-making tool","Abstract":"Studies are largely optimistic about the ability of standardized procedures to constrain decision-makers' biases and produce more equitable results across fields. However, work that embraces standardization as an equalizing force stands in contrast to research on standardization and street-level bureaucrats, which asserts that standardized procedures are not self-actuating and cannot be understood apart from the environments in which they are used. I examine how frontline workers vary in their approach to an actuarial-based tool intended to standardize judgments. In a highly controlled decision-making environment, child welfare workers whose racial and sex characteristics afford them higher status report subverting the tool; conversely, workers in the same position whose ascriptive characteristics yield them lower status in terms of race and sex describe following the rules. In an environment where the same tool is adopted only ceremonially, all workers experience decision-making as unconstrained, regardless of their ascriptive characteristics. This work fills gaps in knowledge about how social status and organizational context intersect to affect rule abidance. Examining these dynamic relationships advances understanding of how organizations reproduce inequality and the limits and potential for standardization to transform social hierarchies.","DOI":"10.1093\/SOCPRO\/SPZ028"},{"Year":2018,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Everyone loves a dog story: Narratives of urban animal welfare policy","Abstract":"Public policy related to animal issues has not been well explored in the urban politics literature. We argue that concerns related to animal welfare are increasingly pressing in many cities yet sustained attention to them appears absent from the urban policy agenda. Using the multiple streams approach, this research examines animal welfare policy in the urban context and suggests why this policy area appears not to have gained a consistent place on the public agenda. Based on a content analysis of media reporting in the Detroit metropolitan area it appears that policy entrepreneurs were unable to access the public agenda through the policy window opened by a major focusing event because of conflicting narratives about the nature of the problem, dissension among policy entrepreneurs themselves, and a lack of debate about potential policy solutions.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spx015"},{"Year":2020,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"The apathy syndrome: How we are trained not to care about politics","Abstract":"The role of emotions in social movements and mobilization has been an important focus of recent research, but the emotional mechanisms producing apathy and nonparticipation remain under studied. This article explores the thinking and feeling processes involved in the production of apolitical attitudes, paying particular attention to their social and cultural context. Cultural norms of appropriateness and emotional expression can hinder or boost the emotions involved in the mobilizing processes. Based on 60 interviews with young people in two Russian cities, collected during and in the aftermath of the antiregime protests of 2011-12, I explore the apathy syndrome-a combination of emotional mechanisms and cultural norms that produce political apathy. Personal frustrating experiences develop into long-term cynicism and disbelief in the efficacy of collective action, a process exacerbated by the transmission of apathy in families and educational institutions, as well as by cultural norms of appropriate emotions. Cultural clich\u00e9s and dissociation from others help people cope with the trap and justify inaction.","DOI":"10.1093\/SOCPRO\/SPZ019"},{"Year":2020,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Presidential address: Start spreading the news: Illuminating the effects of climate change as a social problem","Abstract":"The theme for the 2019 SSSP meetings is a call to sociologists and social scientists to draw on their sociological roots to illuminate the social in all social problems with an eye to solving those problems. The address encourages sociologists to speak as broadly as possible so that the discipline becomes a central voice in larger public discourses. The 2019 SSSP Presidential Address is a call to focus on what is the largest social problem: climate change. After a brief overview of the science of climate change, the address focuses on the anthropogenic causes of climate change and the reasons why climate change is a social justice issue. Looking specifically at rising sea levels, the address then focuses on New York City as an example of the effects of and some responses to climate change. The address concludes with a discussion of how sociologists can and should draw deeply on the discipline's theoretical roots, empirical tools, and pedagogical skills to illuminate climate change as a social problem.

This study addresses this gap by drawing on interviews with male, Latino high school graduates and noncompleters in Los Angeles. Interviews reveal urban violence is the most salient feature of urban neighborhoods and consequential for school completion. In an effort to avoid victimization male youth exposed to urban violence draw on male peer ties for protection. Inherent in these social ties, as in other forms of social capital, are expectations and obligations. I find that an orientation that privileges these expectations and obligations-and not specifically an anti-school orientation-gets male youth \"caught up\" in behavior counterproductive to school completion, like being truant with peers and getting expelled for \"backing them\" in a fight. I find not all urban youth adopt this orientation because youth are differentially exposed to the neighborhood. Family and school institutional factors limit some youth's time in the neighborhood, buffering them from urban violence. These youth then bypass the opportunity and need to draw on male peer ties for protection. Not having to employ these \"strategies of action,\" they avoid getting \"caught up\" and experience higher chances to graduate. This study argues that to understand the cultural orientation that guides behavior that contributes to school noncompletion requires accounting for how the threat of violence punctuates and organizes the daily lives of male urban youth.","DOI":"10.1525\/sp.2013.11237"},{"Year":2015,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"New American relief and development organizations: Voluntarizing global aid","Abstract":"International aid has seen a trend towards decentralization and voluntary action in the last two decades. Relief and development non-governmental organizations (NGOs) registered with the IRS ballooned from about 1,000 in 1990 to over 11,000 in 2010, and most of these are small organizations run on a voluntary basis. These NGOs are headquartered in one-third of all U.S. counties, representing every state in the United States. How can we explain the distribution and the growth of these organizations over time? I use a multilevel model with county means to show that higher per-county income, education, percent of residents born abroad, and higher numbers of religious congregations and Rotary Clubs explain between-county differences, although only education and number of congregations retain positive within-county, over-time effects. The article aims to inject a globalized perspective into theories of nonprofits and voluntarism and to demonstrate that the decentralization of aid to voluntary actors is a phenomenon that must be taken up by scholars of globalization and development.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spv005"},{"Year":2017,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Labor migration and the missing work of homemaking: Three forms of settling for Chinese-Canadian migrants","Abstract":"Much of migration theory has come to revolve around the category of the \"labor migrant,\" without taking into account labor, like homemaking, that remains unrecognized by the market. Drawing from qualitative interviews with thirty-one Chinese migrants in different stages of making a move from Beijing to Vancouver, we attempt to bring better visibility to how the labor involved in homemaking intersects with migration. Defining homemaking as work in the pragmatic-existentialist context of the stabilization of everyday routines, we uncover three themes to homemaking work: settling in, settling down, and settling for. Discussion of these themes reveals two important issues for migration theory: settlement relies upon the work of homemaking and the work of homemaking in many cases motivates migration. For these reasons, the work of homemaking should be more carefully studied within the migration literature.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spw035"},{"Year":2017,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Immigrant bodily incorporation: How the physical body structures identity, mobility, and transnationalism","Abstract":"This article integrates insights from the sociology of the body and the sociology of immigration to examine the role of the body in the immigrant incorporation process. Drawing on three years of participant observation in a West African immigrant community, I show how immigrants from a predominantly agrarian society must adapt and retrain their bodies, often under great pressure, to meet the demands of American social institutions. Immigrants' ability to move their bodies in socially prescribed ways affects three crucial aspects of the incorporation process: identity formation, economic mobility, and transnational practices. Immigrants who struggle to execute the host society's normative bodily movements (1) interpret their bodily challenges as evidence of their outsider identity, (2) struggle to acquire the material resources necessary to achieve more traditionally studied forms of economic incorporation, and (3) face limitations in their ability to maintain transnational networks even as those networks play an increasingly important social role in the face of their blocked mobility. These findings indicate that bodily incorporation is a critical precursor to full incorporation into the host society.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spw029"},{"Year":2014,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"The persistent significance of racial and economic inequality on the size of municipal police forces in the United States, 1980-2010","Abstract":"Recent empirical analyses of the social factors that predict municipal police force size support racial threat theory by suggesting that the racial composition of cities leads to enhanced social control efforts; however, these studies largely ignore explanations based on social class or the influence of an ethnic threat. We examine these alternative threat hypotheses by assessing the potential influence that recent increases in economic inequality and the substantial rise in the Hispanic population in the United States may have had on efforts to control crime. Using an advanced estimation technique to isolate the determinants of police force size in a large sample of U.S. cities between 1980 and 2010, we find that racial threat and economic inequality work both independently and jointly to produce substantial shifts in the size of police forces after accounting for levels of crime as well as other important demographic and structural characteristics. Furthermore, period interactions suggest that racial threat appears to have expanded over the last several decades. Together, our study uncovers novel interactive effects and identifies shifts over time, thus refining existing theoretical assumptions.

This is certainly true for two major interrelated social problems with racial implications: crime and labor market inequalities. In the era since the civil rights movement made the open expression of racial bias less socially acceptable, however, public and political discussions of social problems with racial implications are often framed in purportedly race-neutral ways (Bonilla-Silva 2010; Schuman et al. 1997). Drawing on group position (Blumer 1958) and collective action framing (Benford and Snow 2000) perspectives and employing the 2008-2009 ANES Panel Study, the present work suggests an enduring influence of racial bias on the ways people understand these major social problems. In contrast to earlier eras, however, much of the contemporary role of racial bias is hidden. The current work employs an implicit measure of racial bias that is resistant to a social desirability bias (Payne et al. 2005) to reveal a more complete picture of the influence of racial bias on the way people perceive social problems - even among those who explicitly deny possessing such biases. Specifically, this work reveals roles for both explicit and implicit racial bias in the way non-Hispanic whites identify the severity of problems, attribute blame for problems, and are motivated to concern around particular issues.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spu003"},{"Year":2014,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Brothers and others: Organizing masculinity, disorganizing workers","Abstract":"Sociologists have long argued that hegemonic masculinity serves as an organizing tool, uniting men around a collective identity by excluding women and subordinate men. This article reformulates existing theories by analyzing organizing drives among an occupationally segregated, ethnically diverse group of men. Ten months of participant observation and 30 in-depth interviews with street vendors in New York City revealed how the exclusionary processes involved in constructing a collective gendered identity can disrupt solidarity and collective action. Organizers attempted to orient members around \"brotherhood\" in a context where disparate cultural histories and occupational networks shaped interpretive disagreements over masculinity. These interpretive disagreements eventually alienated members and undermined mobilization. Organizational failures such as these allude to the limits social movements face in manipulating gender for institutional purposes. These limits may be especially relevant for resource poor, voluntary organizations that preside over a heterogeneous base.","DOI":"10.1525\/sp.2013.12021"},{"Year":2016,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Gossip as Social Control: Informal Sanctions on Ethical Violations in Scientific Workplaces","Abstract":"Research on misconduct in science has largely focused on egregious violations such as fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism. Recent scholarship, however, calls for greater attention to forms of everyday misconduct and how scientists navigate ethical ambiguity when they are unable or unwilling to make formal accusations. Drawing on interview data from 251 physicists and biologists from both elite and non-elite universities and research institutes in the United States, United Kingdom, and India, we find that scientists are often reticent or unable to take formal action against many behaviors they perceive as unethical and irresponsible. As a result, they resort to informal gossip to warn colleagues of transgressors. Many express confidence that such pro-social gossip can serve as a means of social control by tarnishing the reputations of transgressors. Yet its effectiveness as a form of social control is limited, particularly when transgressors enjoy higher status than gossipers. We identify two types and three consequences of such gossip and assess the effectiveness of gossip as a means of social control. Finally, we consider the implications of our study for understanding and decreasing misconduct in science.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spw022"},{"Year":2018,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"The digital activism gap: How class and costs shape online collective action","Abstract":"What is the relationship between social class and online participation in social movements? Scholars suggest that low costs to digital activism broaden participation and challenge conventional collective action theories, but given the digital divide, little is known about cost variation across social movement organizations from different social classes. A focus on high levels of digital engagement and extraordinary events leaves scant information about the effect of social class on digital mobilization patterns and everyday practices within and across organizations. This study takes a field-level approach to incorporate all groups involved in one statewide political issue, thereby including organizations with different social class compositions, from Tea Parties to labor unions. Data collection spans online and off-line digital activism practices. With an index to measure digital engagement from an original data set of over 90,000 online posts, findings show deep digital activism inequalities between working-class and middle\/upper-class groups. In-depth interviews and ethnographic observations reveal that the mechanisms of this digital activism gap are organizational resources, along with individual disparities in access, skills, empowerment and time. These factors create high costs of online participation for working-class groups. Rather than reduced costs equalizing online participation, substantial costs contribute to digital activism inequality.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spx042"},{"Year":2018,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Neighborhoods and food insecurity in households with young children: A disadvantage paradox?","Abstract":"In the United States, more than 1 in 5 households with children are unable to access and provide adequate food for a healthy, active lifestyle. We argue that the contribution of local context for food insecurity risk has largely been overlooked in favor of focusing on individual family characteristics, and that this is problematic given that mitigating food insecurity may be a communal process. We examine the relevance of neighborhood contributors to food insecurity among children, utilizing geocoded and nationally-representative data from the ECLS-K: 2010-2011 kindergarten cohort. We find little evidence that neighborhood socioeconomic, food retail, or social services characteristics directly impact food insecurity risk. However, our results reveal that family and neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics combine to impact food insecurity in ways consistent with a disadvantage paradox. As neighborhood concentrated disadvantage increases, higher-SES families' risk of food insecurity increases, but lower-SES families' risk decreases. This paradox is not explained by a higher concentration of social service organizations in more disadvantaged neighborhoods, and we theorize that impoverished families with children may share information and resources in disadvantaged communities to avoid food insecurity.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spw054"},{"Year":2016,"Source title":"Social Problems","Title":"Trajectories of Economic Disconnection among Families in the Child Welfare System","Abstract":"This study examined economic disconnection, an extreme case of economic exclusion in which families lack both employment and cash assistance, among families in the child welfare system. We hypothesized that child welfare intervention has the potential to be a mechanism of economic inclusion or exclusion for vulnerable families, with implications for family reunification. We utilized a novel administrative dataset containing data from three state agencies to construct income histories of parents relative to their child's placement in foster care (N = 15,159 parents). We identified eight trajectories using group-based trajectory modeling. About two-thirds of parents experience economic disconnection over a three-year period; these families are least likely to reunify. Although providing economic resources to families is typically beyond the scope of child welfare, efforts to minimize the negative impact of child placement on parents' economic connection is likely to improve both the economic inclusion of poor families and family reunification.","DOI":"10.1093\/socpro\/spw006"}]
