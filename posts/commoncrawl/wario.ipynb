    "I've always been intrigued by the idea of the Common Crawl News dataset. Since 2016, the non-profit organization Common Crawl has been collecting a specialized dataset of media articles, with new releases every day. While this dataset is smaller than the full Common Crawl, which currently stands at 454 terabytes and contains around 3 billion web pages, it is still a potentially useful and underutilized resource, both in terms of size and the process of extracting the news stories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, you'll find my code for downloading one day's worth of data from the Common Crawl News dataset, which amounts to approximately 20 gigabytes. After running the code, I obtained 59,866 English language articles for April 20th, 2024. The process was time-consuming, taking about eight hours, with most of that time spent on extracting the text from the WARC (Web ARChive) files. \n",
    "\n",
    "I attempted to optimize the code and speed up the extraction process, but most of those efforts were unsuccessful, likely because the parts I was trying to parallelize were not the primary bottlenecks. It's important to note that a significant portion of the articles in the dataset are likely to be spam or press releases. However, I believe there is enough valuable content within the dataset to make it a worthwhile resource for those willing to invest the time and effort to process it."
