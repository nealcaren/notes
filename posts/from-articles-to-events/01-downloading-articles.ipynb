    "This is part one of an attempt to expand on a working paper, \"[Extracting protest events from newspaper articles with ChatGPT](https://osf.io/dvht7)\" that I wrote with Andy Andrews and Rashawn Ray. In that paper, we tested whether ChatGPT could replace my undergraduate RAs in extracting details about Black Lives Matter protests from media accounts. This time, I want to expand it to include more articles, movements, and variables.\n",

Their dataset includes event characteristics for over a hundred thousand protest events and the source web addresses. I aim to test if GPT models can replicate their hand-coding results, but this script just gets the data."
