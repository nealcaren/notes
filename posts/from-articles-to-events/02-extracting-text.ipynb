In that paper, we tested whether ChatGPT could replace my undergraduate RAs in extracting details about Black Lives Matter protests from media accounts. This time, I want to expand it to include more articles, movements, and variables.\n",

Rather than build custom parsers for each webpage, I'm going to use the wonderful [Newspaper3k](https://newspaper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library to extract the relevant information from each article. It works on almost every media site, so it's incredibly useful for turning HTML into something useful."
