- **Controlling Flow**: Explain the significance of control structures in managing the flow of a Python program. Provide examples of if statements for decision-making processes and loops (for and while) for iterating over data sets.

#### Exploring Python Libraries for Social Science
- **Scikit-learn**: Introduce Scikit-learn as a versatile tool for machine learning in Python. Discuss its applications in statistical modeling and prediction, with examples relevant to social science like logistic regression and clustering.
- **Matplotlib**: Explain how Matplotlib can be used to visualize data, which is crucial in understanding trends and patterns. Show simple plot types like line graphs and histograms.
- **Pandas**: Describe how Pandas provides data structures and data analysis tools, which make manipulating numerical tables and time series easy and intuitive. Provide examples showing data manipulation tasks common in social science, like filtering data and merging datasets.

#### Developing Good Programming Habits
- **Coding Best Practices**: Discuss the importance of writing clean and readable code. Cover concepts like naming conventions, commenting, and the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself). Introduce the concept of refactoring and regular code reviews.
- **Using Version Control**: Provide an introduction to version control systems, focusing on git. Discuss how git can help manage changes to source code over time, including tracking modifications, reverting to previous versions, and collaborating with others. Offer a basic tutorial on setting up git, committing changes, and pushing to a repository like GitHub.
