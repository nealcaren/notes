    "# Coding the Date of a Protest Event from a Media Account\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Carefully Read the Article\n",
    "- Read through the entire article text thoroughly\n",
    "- Identify and underline/highlight any phrases that indicate a date or time period relative to the publication date (e.g., \"yesterday\", \"Saturday\", \"the day after Easter\", \"last week\", \"two months ago\", etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Determine the Publication Date\n",
    "- Obtain the publication date of the article from the provided information\n",
    "- Write down the publication date in a standard format (e.g., March 24, 2024)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Create a Calendar Reference\n",
    "- Prepare a reference calendar for the year of the publication date\n",
    "- This can be a printed calendar or a handwritten one, whichever is more convenient\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Interpret Relative Date Phrases\n",
    "- For each relative date phrase identified in the article, interpret it based on the publication date and the calendar reference:\n",
    " - \"yesterday\": Count back one day from the publication date on the calendar\n",
    " - Weekday names (e.g., \"Saturday\"): Find the closest day before or on the publication date that matches the mentioned weekday\n",
    " - \"the day after Easter\": Determine the date of Easter for that year, and count one day after that date on the calendar\n",
    " - \"last week\": Count back 7 days from the publication date\n",
    " - \"two months ago\": Count back 2 months from the publication date's month, adjusting the day if necessary\n",
    " - Other relative phrases: Use logical reasoning and the calendar to interpret the phrase relative to the publication date\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Identify the Protest Event Description\n",
    "- Carefully read through the article again, looking for the section(s) that describe the protest event itself\n",
    "- Underline or highlight the key details and descriptions related to the protest you need to date\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Prioritize Relevant Date Phrases\n",
    "- From the list of relative date phrases identified earlier, prioritize the ones that are in closest proximity to the protest event description\n",
    "- If multiple date phrases are equally close, use your best judgment based on the context clues in the article to determine which is more likely referring to the protest date\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Cross-Reference with Event Details\n",
    "- As you interpret each prioritized date phrase, cross-reference it with the key details about the protest event, such as:\n",
    " - Location mentioned (does the calculated date make sense for that location?)\n",
    " - Other events or incidents described around the protest (does the interpreted date align with the chronology?)\n",
    " - Quotes from organizers or participants about timing (do they corroborate the calculated date?)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Resolve Ambiguity\n",
    "- If multiple relative date phrases are present, prioritize the one closest to the description of the event in the article text\n",
    "- If phrases conflict, use your best judgment based on the context and chronology of events described in the article\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Record the Calculated Date\n",
    "- Once you have interpreted the relevant relative date phrase(s), record the calculated date in a YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., 2023-04-13)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10. Double-Check and Revise if Necessary\n",
    "- Review your work, ensuring that the calculated date aligns with the context and details provided in the article\n",
    "- If needed, revise your interpretation or consult additional resources (e.g., historical calendars, Easter date calculators) to validate your date calculation\n",
    "- Be open to revising your date calculation based on additional context clues surrounding the protest event itself\n",

    "“We know that more than 1,200 Ohioans have been lost to police violence since the year 2000,” Ohio Families United for Political Action and Change (OFUPAC) Organizing Director Elaine Schleiffer said. “We wanted to represent the loss that that is, the empty shoes, that there’s no replacing those family members.”\n",

    "OFUPAC is a non-profit organization that unites families who have lost loved ones in officer-involved shootings.\n",

    "“We’re just here also, to, like, celebrate and love each other,” Jordan, who is also OFUPAC’s founder, said. “You know, connect.”\n",

    "Tania Hudson’s son was fatally shot by a Columbus police officer in 2015. \n",

    "“Accountability? How much more accountability can they ask for,” FOP Executive Vice President Brian Steel said. “We have an internal affairs. We have an inspector general’s office. We’re investigated by BCI in, say, a police-involved shooting, in a grand jury of our peers. There’s literally no more accountability that can be put on police officers today.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Accountability is pretty much all that we can ask for,” Hudson said. “We can’t say justice – ours is gone. There will never be justice for us, but we’re out here trying to save other people’s lives. That’s why we’re constantly out here.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Protestors also mentioned their frustration with Marsy’s Law, which was originally passed to protect the victims of violent crimes, but which was extended to allow law enforcement departments to shield officers’ names when they are involved in a shooting.

Kinsella said she hopes the protest helps build a stronger presence for the club.\\n\\nOrganizer Sarah Swenson said she hopes even those students who participated in the walkout to escape class rather than support the cause still took something away from their message.\\n\\n“I’m glad they came out because hopefully they heard something in the speech that will impact how they act in the future,” Swenson said.\""
