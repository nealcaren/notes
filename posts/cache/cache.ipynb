    "Anthropic recently announced a new feature called \"prompt caching\" for the Claude API. This feature allows users to store complex instructions or multiple examples in the API's memory, making them readily available for repeated use. While caching prompts initially costs 25% more than standard API usage, subsequent uses of cached prompts are 90% cheaper, offering significant cost savings for repetitive tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This new feature holds particular promise for social scientists, like myself, who frequently process large volumes of documents using consistent sets of instructions. \n",
    "\n",
    "To test it out, I thought I would try prompt caching on my current project of extracting quotes from newspaper articles about protest events."

    "# Analysis of Direct Quotes, Slogans, and Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "You are an AI assitant tasked with constructing a Markdown table using information from a newspaper article.\n",
    "\n",
    "When analyzing media coverage of protests, it's essential to systematically capture and categorize the key quotes, slogans, chants, and statements made by various participants and stakeholders. This process allows for a clearer understanding of the perspectives, motivations, and messages conveyed during the protest. Whether you’re studying climate demonstrations, social justice movements, or any other form of protest, organizing this information into a structured table can greatly enhance your analysis and presentation of the event.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following instructions provide a step-by-step guide to building a comprehensive table that categorizes and classifies quotes, slogans, chants, and statements from protest-related articles. This table will help you differentiate between the voices of protesters, bystanders, targets, and law enforcement, and will allow you to clearly present the various messages and actions that define the protest.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify the Content:** \n",
    "   - Start by carefully reading the article and identifying all the direct quotes, slogans, chants, and statements. Highlight or note each instance where someone is directly quoted or where slogans/chants are mentioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Extract the Content:**\n",
    "   - For each identified content, extract the exact wording used in the article. Ensure you capture the quote, slogan, chant, or statement accurately. Use only direct quotes, ignore paraphrasing or other indirect quotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Determine the Source:**\n",
    "   - Identify who said or wrote each quote, slogan, chant, or statement. This could be an individual (e.g., a government official), a group (e.g., a protest organization), or an entity (e.g., a company).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Classify the Role:**\n",
    "   - Determine the role of the person or group who made the statement. Roles might include:\n",
    "     - **Protester:** The individual or group actively involved in the protest.\n",
    "     - **Bystander:** An observer who is neither directly involved in the protest nor its target.\n",
    "     - **Target:** A person or entity that the protest or action is aimed at.\n",
    "     - **Elected Official:** A person who holds elected or appointed office..\n",
    "     - **Law Enforcement:** Police, government officials, or other authorities responding to the protest.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Classify the Type of Content:**\n",
    "   - Determine whether the content is a:\n",
    "     - **Quote:** A direct statement made by an individual or group.\n",
    "     - **Statement:** A formal declaration or assertion made by a group or individual, often in a press release or public statement.\n",
    "     - **Slogan:** A short and memorable phrase used by the protestors, often seen on banners or signs.\n",
    "     - **Chant:** A rhythmic phrase repeated by a crowd, usually during a protest.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Create the Table:**\n",
    "   - Set up a table with the following columns:\n",
    "     1. **Quote/Statement:** The exact wording of the quote, slogan, chant, or statement.\n",
    "     2. **Who Said It:** The individual, group, or entity that made the statement or created the slogan/chant.\n",
    "     3. **Description:** A brief description of who the person or group is, including their role or title.\n",
    "     4. **Role:** Classify the person or group as a protester, bystander, target, or law enforcement.\n",
    "     5. **Type:** Classify the content as a quote, statement, slogan, or chant.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Populate the Table:**\n",
    "   - Fill in the table with the information you’ve gathered. Ensure that each row corresponds to a specific quote, slogan, chant, or statement, and that all columns are accurately completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Review for Accuracy:**\n",
    "   - Double-check the table for any errors or omissions. Ensure that the content matches the source material and that the roles and types are correctly assigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Present the Table:**\n",
    "   - Once the table is complete, it can be presented or used for analysis, ensuring that it provides a clear and organized overview of the key content from the article.\n",
