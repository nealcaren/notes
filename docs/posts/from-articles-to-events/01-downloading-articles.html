<p>This is part one of an attempt to expand on a working paper, “<a href="https://osf.io/dvht7">Extracting protest events from newspaper articles with ChatGPT</a>” that I wrote with Andy Andrews and Rashawn Ray. In that paper, we tested whether ChatGPT could replace my undergraduate RAs in extracting details about Black Lives Matter protests from media accounts. This time, I want to expand it to include more articles, movements, and variables.</p>
<p>In this part, I largely copy <a href="https://nealcaren.github.io/notes/posts/scraping/bulk-download.html">old code on downloading</a> to help gather a couple of thousand articles from the <a href="https://github.com/nonviolent-action-lab/crowd-counting-consortium">Crowd Counting Consortium</a>’s dataset. Their dataset includes event characteristics for over a hundred thousand protest events and the source web addresses. I aim to test if GPT models can replicate their hand-coding results, but this script just gets the data.</p>

<p>I ended up running the last few cells almost a dozen times, sometimes tweaking the script in attempt to download more articles, other times because I accidentally stopped the process by closing my laptop. I ended up about 3,059 articles. I suspect that most of the URLS that I couldn’t get were sites where CloudFlare or whatever popup was blocking me for not being a human while some smaller share are invalid URLs.</p>
