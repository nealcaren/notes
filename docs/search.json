    "text": "This is part one of an attempt to expand on a working paper, “Extracting protest events from newspaper articles with ChatGPT” that I wrote with Andy Andrews and Rashawn Ray. In that paper, we tested whether ChatGPT could replace my undergraduate RAs in extracting details about Black Lives Matter protests from media accounts. This time, I want to expand it to include more articles, movements, and variables.\nIn this part, I largely copy old code on downloading to help gather a couple of thousand articles from the Crowd Counting Consortium’s dataset. Their dataset includes event characteristics for over a hundred thousand protest events and the source web addresses. I aim to test if GPT models can replicate their hand-coding results, but this script just gets the data.\n\npip  install -U pyppeteer python-slugify  chromedriver-py\n\n\nimport os\nimport asyncio\nimport nest_asyncio\nfrom random import shuffle\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nfrom slugify import slugify\nfrom pyppeteer import launch\nfrom pyppeteer.errors import NetworkError\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\n\nnest_asyncio.apply()\n\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\n    \"https://github.com/nonviolent-action-lab/crowd-counting-consortium/raw/master/ccc_compiled_2021-present.csv\",\n    encoding=\"latin\",\n    low_memory=False,\n)\nprint(len(df))\n\n103986\n\n\n\n# Limit to just 2023 or 2024\ndf = df[pd.to_datetime(df[\"date\"]).dt.year.isin([2023,2024])]\nprint(len(df))\n\n# Keep only with one source \ndf.dropna(subset=['source_2'], inplace=True)\nlen(df)\ndf['Keep'] = True\nprint(df['Keep'].sum())\n\n# Step 2: Eliminate social media URLs and ensure they contain 'http'\nsocial_media_domains = [\"twitter.com\", \"youtube.com\", \"facebook.com\", \"instagram.com\", \"tiktok.com\", \"bsky.com\"]\nfor sm_domain in social_media_domains:\n    df['Keep'] = df['Keep'] & (~df['source_1'].str.contains(sm_domain) & df['source_1'].str.contains(\"http\"))\n\nprint(df['Keep'].sum())\n\n# Step 3: Filter URLs to keep only those that appear once\n# Count occurrences of each URL\nurl_counts = df.loc[df['Keep'], 'source_1'].value_counts()\n\n# Here, we use 'map' to align counts with the original DataFrame, checking if each count equals 1\nunique_url_mask = df['source_1'].map(url_counts) == 1\n\n# Update the 'Keep' column: True only if previously True AND the URL is unique (appears once)\ndf['Keep'] = df['Keep'] & unique_url_mask\n\nprint(df['Keep'].sum())\n\n37378\n16284\n8400\n3398\n\n\n\n# Save the subset\n\ndf = df[df['Keep']]\ndf.to_json('ccc_sample.json', orient='records')\n\n\n# Load the subset and make a list of the URLS\n\ndf = pd.read_json('ccc_sample.json')\nurls = df['source_1'].values\nshuffle(urls)\n\nBelow are slightly revised functions from earlier.

It takes a dataset on 600 recent articles from sociology journals and uses ChatGPT to generate hypothetical abstracts. Creating synthetic datasets is often used to train other models.

The process involves:\n\nAbstract Class Definition: A BaseModel from Pydantic is used to define the expected structure of an abstract, ensuring that the generated text aligns with specific guidelines (six to eight sentences and approximately 150 to 200 words).\nFunction to Generate Abstract: The function abstract_from_title takes an article title as input and utilizes the OpenAI API, specifically the gpt-3.5-turbo model, to generate a relevant abstract. gpt-4-turbo is more creative and better at following directions, but also 20x more expensive. The function sets up a scenario where the AI is an academic editor tasked with creating an abstract that meets the defined criteria.\nAbstract Generation: It then calls the OpenAI API, passing the article title and the scenario as inputs, and processes the API’s response to extract the generated abstract text.\n\n\nclass Abstract(BaseModel):\n    abstract: str = Field(..., description=\"Text of the hypothetical abstract of a sociology article.\")\n\ndef abstract_from_title(title):\n    client = OpenAI(\n        max_retries=3,\n        timeout=90.0, \n    )\n\n    messages = [\n        {\n            \"role\": \"system\",\n            \"content\": ''' You are an academic editor who excels at writing for sociology journals.

Using data from a large-scale survey, the research explores how various family structures and dynamics impact the quality and strength of intergenerational relationships. Findings reveal that mothers play a crucial role in shaping and maintaining these ties, acting as the primary emotional caregivers and facilitators of family connections across generations. Furthermore, the study uncovers the mechanisms through which maternal influence can either strengthen or weaken intergenerational bonds, highlighting the significance of maternal involvement in family networks. The implications of these findings extend to theories of family sociology and provide insights for policymakers and practitioners working to support healthy intergenerational relationships. By shedding light on the complexities of family dynamics into adulthood, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the enduring impact of maternal roles on intergenerational ties.\n\n\nThe cell below uses the function to call the API, in parallel, to create an abstract, if one hasn’t already been created.\n\nChecking synthetic_titles: First, it tries to print the number of titles already processed and stored in synthetic_titles. If synthetic_titles doesn’t exist yet (it’s the first run or it’s been reset), it initializes synthetic_titles as an empty dictionary and prints “0” to indicate it’s starting from scratch.\nParallel Processing with ThreadPoolExecutor: To speed up the process of generating abstracts, the script uses ThreadPoolExecutor to run multiple instances of the abstract_from_title function in parallel. It’s set to work on up to 5 titles at the same time.\nGenerating Abstracts: For each title that doesn’t already have an abstract in synthetic_titles, it submits a job to generate an abstract using the abstract_from_title function from above.\nHandling Results and Exceptions: As each job (or “future”) completes, the script attempts to retrieve the resulting abstract. Successful abstracts are printed out and saved to synthetic_titles alongside their corresponding title. If an error occurs during the generation process, an exception is printed with the title that caused it.\n\nThis seems to create about 99% of abstracts on the first try, so I run it twice to catch any that might have gotten lost along the way. This is the advantage of storing the results in the synthetic_titles, instead of, say, applying the function directly to the title column in the dataframe.\n\ntitles = df['Title'].values\n\ntry:\n    print(len(synthetic_titles))\nexcept:\n    synthetic_titles = {}\n    print(\"0\")\n\nwith ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5) as executor:\n    # Start the load operations for titles not in synthetic_titles\n    future_to_title = {executor.submit(abstract_from_title, title): title for title in titles if title not in synthetic_titles}\n    \n    for future in as_completed(future_to_title):\n        title = future_to_title[future]\n        try:\n            abstract = future.result()\n            print(abstract)\n            # Assign the abstract to the corresponding title in synthetic_titles\n            synthetic_titles[title] = abstract\n        except Exception as exc:\n            print(f\"{title!r} generated an exception: {exc}\")\n\n597\nThis article delves into the complex dynamics of power, resistance, and injustice within the oil and gas industry. Focusing on the concept of meta-power, it explores how dominant actors in the industry exert control and influence over various stakeholders. Through a critical analysis of case studies, the article examines instances where resistance to this meta-power is framed as a struggle for rights and justice. The interplay between regulatory frameworks, corporate interests, and community activism is carefully scrutinized to highlight the structural inequalities at play. By shedding light on these power dynamics, the article aims to contribute to broader discussions on social justice and the right to resist in corporate contexts. The findings underscore the importance of recognizing and challenging meta-power structures to address systemic injustices in the oil and gas fields.\nThis study examines the intricate dynamics of interaction, identity, and influence within the U.S. Senate from 1973 to 2009. Through a comprehensive analysis of Senate proceedings, voting patterns, and speeches, the research uncovers the nuanced ways in which senators pull closer together and move further apart over time. By employing sociological theories of group behavior and political sociology, the study explores how individual identities and group affiliations shape the collective actions and decisions of Senate members. The findings reveal the complex interplay between personal interactions, political ideologies, and institutional norms in the Senate chamber. This research contributes to our understanding of how social processes influence legislative outcomes and policy decisions in a complex political setting. Overall, the study highlights the significance of interpersonal relationships and group dynamics in shaping the functioning of one of the most powerful legislative bodies in the world.\n'\"Take one for the team!\" individual heterogeneity and the emergence of latent norms in a volunteer\\'s dilemma' generated an exception: Expecting ':' delimiter: line 383 column 3 (char 1621)\n\n\nFor fun, I double the size of the dataframe, half having the original abstract and half having the fake one.\n\n# Step 1: Create a copy of the original DataFrame\ndf_original = df.copy()\n\n# Step 2: Add \"Abstract source\" set to \"Original\"\ndf_original['Abstract source'] = 'Original'\n\n# Step 3: Create a second copy of the DataFrame for the GPT 3.5 version\ndf_gpt = df.copy()\n\n# Step 4: Change \"Abstract source\" to \"GPT 3.5\"\ndf_gpt['Abstract source'] = 'GPT 3.5'\n\n# Step 5: Update \"Abstract\" with values from synthetic_titles\n# Assuming the titles are in a column named 'title'\ndf_gpt['Abstract'] = ''\ndf_gpt['Abstract'] = df_gpt['Title'].replace(synthetic_titles)\ndf_gpt.to_json('abstract_gpt35.json', orient='records')\n\n# Step 6: Concatenate the two DataFrames\ndf_doubled = pd.concat([df_original, df_gpt], ignore_index=True)\n\nA quick plot to show the synthetic abstracts are still too short.\n\n\ndef count_words(abstract):\n    # Simple word count by splitting the text by spaces\n    return len(abstract.split())\n\n# Apply the function to the 'Abstract' column to create the new feature\ndf_doubled['word_count'] = df_doubled['Abstract'].astype(str).apply(count_words)\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# Create a boxplot of the word count distribution for each journal\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\nsns.boxplot(x='Abstract source', y='word_count', data=df_doubled)\n\n# Set the title and labels for the plot\nplt.title('Distribution of Word Count in Abstracts by Source')\nplt.xlabel('Source')\nplt.ylabel('Word Count')\n\n# Rotate the x labels for better readability if necessary\nplt.xticks(rotation=45)\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()"

    "title": "Measuring text similarity with sentence embeddings",
    "section": "",
    "text": "A recent talk made me think about measuring the distance between a concept and a text. I know that, for example, Dustin Stolz and Marshall A. Taylor developed “Concept Mover’s Distance” and that folks like Laura K. Nelson have done nifty things, but I haven’t really thought about the idea much in years. Most of the sociological work has used word embeddings, which are constructed using algorithms like Word2Vec, GloVe, or FastText, to analyze a set of texts and translate words into vectors based on the context in which words appear and their co-occurrence with other words. These vectors capture semantic and syntactic similarities among words. Sentences, paragraphs, or longer texts are represented as the average value of their word embeddings, and the method works quite well for measuring how similar two texts are based on the distance between their word embeddings. In contrast, sentence embeddings generated from models like BERT or other transformer-based architectures do not merely combine word vectors. Instead, these models are trained to understand the context and relationships between words in a sentence, producing embeddings that capture the nuanced meaning of the entire sentence. Fine-tuning these models on specific tasks, such as text similarity, further enhances their ability to represent sentences in a way that aligns with the task’s requirements. The resulting sentence transformer models seem to be what most people are using today, so I thought I would play around with them. That said, most of the interesting sociological work has been folks computing their own word vectors, but I’m just going to use a pretrained model.\n\npip install -U --q sentence-transformers\n\nhuggingface/tokenizers: The current process just got forked, after parallelism has already been used.

The overall sentence similarity score (0.36) closely aligns with the highest word similarity score, indicating that sentence embeddings can indeed capture the essence of the concept in relation to the full sentence context.\nIn the second case, the concept “thankful attitude” has the highest similarity with the word “Grateful” (0.50), which is intuitive given the semantic closeness of “thankful” and “Grateful.” However, the overall similarity between the entire sentence “Grateful Dead show” and the concept “thankful attitude” is lower (0.20), suggesting that while individual words like “Grateful” strongly resonate with the concept, the context provided by the entire sentence shifts the meaning away from the concept’s core, demonstrating how sentence embeddings can differentiate between the significance of individual words and the collective meaning of a sentence.\nNo measuring some sentence similarities.\n\ndef string_string_sim(text1,\n                      text2,\n):\n    text1_embedding = model.encode(text1)\n    text2_embedding = model.encode(text2)\n\n    similarity = util.pytorch_cos_sim(text1_embedding, text2_embedding)[0][0]\n    print(f'Similarity is {similarity:.2f}.')\n\n\nstring_string_sim('We study revolutions.', 'This paper examines social movements.')\n\nSimilarity is 0.47.\n\n\n\nstring_string_sim('We study revolutions.', 'This paper examines health behaviors.')\n\nSimilarity is 0.18.\n\n\n\nstring_string_sim('We study revolutions.', 'This paper examines social movements in Algeria during the 1970s.')\n\nSimilarity is 0.36.\n\n\nThis also worked. Note, however, that the last example had a lower correlation with “We study revolutions.” This is because the the additional information in the sentence, like the country and time, were uncorrelated with the shorter, first sentence. I suspect this means that, on average, longer texts will have a lower correlation with a short, conceptual phrase than shorter texts simply because they are more likely to include different types of information.\nOn to measuring a concept. In this case, I’m interested in to what degree a sociological research article’s abstract is about measuring social movements and protest.\n\nmovement_word_list=['social movement', 'contentious politics', 'mobilization',]\n\nmovement_words = ', '.join(movement_word_list)\n\n\nstring_string_sim(movement_words,\n                      'We study revolutions.',\n)\n\nSimilarity is 0.44.\n\n\n\nstring_string_sim(movement_words,\n                      'This paper examines health behaviors.',\n)\n\nSimilarity is 0.18.\n\n\n\nstring_string_sim(movement_words,\n                      'We study revolutions in Algeria.',\n)\n\nSimilarity is 0.42.\n\n\nGreat.

Mostly, I was interested in ways to get it to make different styles of tweets, such as ones that summarize the article vs ones that highlight a single insight.\n\npip install openai pydantic -q\n\nNote: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.\n\n\n\nimport json\n\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\nfrom typing import Optional, List\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nimport pandas as pd\n\npd.set_option('display.max_colwidth', 300)\n\nPydantic is a library that helps define the shape and type of our data, making sure it matches our expectations before we proceed with our code. Here’s a breakdown of the code block using Pydantic:\n\nBaseModel: This is a key part of Pydantic. Think of it as a blueprint for the data you expect. You define a class that inherits from BaseModel, and in it, you detail the structure of your data.\nFields: Inside each class that inherits from BaseModel, we define what data we expect using fields. For example, content: str means we expect a piece of data named content that should be a string. The Field(...) function is used to add extra details about each field, like a description or default value.\nClasses Defined:\n\nSummaryTweet: A class for creating objects that represent a concise version of an abstract.\nAnnounceTweet: A class for making objects that represent a tweet announcing a new article.\nInsightTweet: This class is for objects that encapsulate a simple insight from complex social science concepts.\nThreadTweet: A class for a list of tweets, making up a thread about an article.\nGenerateTweets: This class combines all the above, organizing them into lists of each type of tweet.\n\nList Fields: When we want to store multiple items (like multiple tweets of the same kind), we use List[SomeClass]. This tells Pydantic we expect a list where each item is an instance of SomeClass.\n\nThis code essentially sets up a structure for handling different types of tweets as data objects. By defining these classes, we ensure that the data we work with matches our expectations, reducing bugs and making our code more reliable.\n\nclass SummaryTweet(BaseModel):\n    content: str = Field(..., description=\"A concise version of the abstract in tweet format.

Drawing on my research on nationalist movements, I discuss the narrative flexibility and emotional power of nationalism and consider how these characteristics fuel a particularly resentful form of majoritarian nationalism—MAGAism. I identify five points of entry for MAGA participation, starting with this bitter majoritarian nationalism, then populism, then traditional conservatism, next a Trumpian personality cult, and ending with the alt-right’s extreme white supremacism and fascism. I then discuss two forces that gather this unlikely collection of groups and individuals under the MAGA umbrella: (1) the flexibility of social identity and how it allows status-threat narratives to subsume and redirect economic and political claims; (2) the social media environment of the 2020s, cut loose from the traditional gatekeepers of news and information, wherein maximizing hits—not accuracy—is the guiding principle. On the one hand, social media intensify the prominence of the demagogic celebrity at the helm of the Republican Party, Donald J. Trump. On the other hand, alt-right trolls compete for prominence by seeking outrageousness and shock value, enhanced by algorithms that create a closed information environment. These social media trends pull MAGA adherents further to the right by inflaming public discourse and building the movement on lies and conspiracies.\nINTRODUCTION: The rise of far right-wing parties and extremist groups is now a topic of deep concern among social scientists who study collective action and contentious politics.  As a reader of this special issue of Mobilization, this trend no doubt has been on your mind a lot, as it has been on mine—especially the challenges it poses to democratic institutions.i In the U.S. today, one of the major political parties actively restricts voting rights, bans books in libraries, embraces conspiracies, flaunts constitutional principles, and limits public-school curricula on topics such as diversity, slavery, gender and sexuality (Natanson 2023a, 2023b)—and millions of MAGA supporters are okay with it (Baker, Perry, and Whitehead, 2020; Enders, Farhart, Miller, and Uscinski 2022; Graham et al. 2021; Stewart 2023). Further along the right-wing spectrum, one increasingly finds rising antisemitism, white Christian nationalism, gun-toting bullies, and misogynists (see Davis and Kettrey’s study in this issue) in the U.S. public sphere, raising parallels with European history in the early twentieth century and its brown shirts and black shirts (rather than today’s polo shirts and tac gear). While violence and intolerance are not unique to the extreme right, these trends reflect a synergy between the current political environment, eroding democratic norms, and—among more and more citizens in democratic states—authoritarian and even fascist tendencies (Jackson 2021; Wintemute, Robinson, Tomish 2022). In the U.S. these trends can be grouped under the umbrella of MAGAism where majoritarian nationalism mixes with populism, far-right extremism, and a virtual (in both meanings of the term) potpourri of themes such as antiwokeness, antivaccines, parental rights, gun rights, sovereign citizenry, science denial, masculinity, the lie of a stolen 2020 election, Trumpian personality cult, white replacement, QAnon conspiracies, among many others. This essay contextualizes the special issue articles by situating them in relation to trends in the U.S., which I discuss under the big umbrella of MAGAism. Following Tarrow (2021: 175), common usage in the popular press, and Trump himself, I consider MAGAism as a general social movement, one that encompasses the rightward shift of public discourse and politics in the U.S. plus the array of mobilizing groups that drive it.ii  I will offer a somewhat personalized essay that draws on insights from my work on the power (and danger) of nationalism to analyze a particularly resentful majoritarian nationalism—often labeled white nationalism in the U.S.  (Graham et al. 2021; Mudde 2019, Miller-Idriss, 2021; Young 2017). I am interested not only in militias, alt-right trolls, and white-supremacist churches,  but—more broadly—the mechanisms that allow these extremists to be grouped with millions of middle-class working citizens who come to the movement via parental-rights groups, suburban bible-study groups, or as antivaxxers, tradition-alists, or Constitutionalists.  MAGAism is a big-tent collective action—a movement with continuity, shared identity, diverse claims and political objectives, networked by an array of groups and organizations—the movement’s mobilizing structures that mostly stand apart from the Republican Party.

Instead of visiting each website individually, the script visits multiple websites simultaneously and saves what it finds. Rather than requesting the page through Python, it uses a “headless” web browser, which is much more likely to get you the actual content you want.\nThis approach works best when the URLs are from different servers. You will eventually get locked out if you try to visit the same web server multiple times in the same second, but there’s no reason not to visit five different websites at once.

It uses a headless Chrome browser, controlled via the Pyppeteer library, to render pages just as they would appear in a web browser. This approach is particularly useful for capturing dynamically generated content, which traditional HTTP requests might miss.\nKey components of the script include:\n\nHTML Directory Creation: At the start, the script ensures that there is a designated directory (named ‘HTML’) where all downloaded page contents will be saved. If this directory does not exist, it is created.\nUser Agent Setting: A user agent string is defined and used for all requests to mimic a real web browser, helping to avoid potential blocking by web servers that may restrict access to non-browser clients.\nfetch Function: The core of the script is the fetch function. This asynchronous function takes a browser page object, a URL, and an optional timeout parameter. It performs the following actions for each URL:\n\nURL Slugification: Converts the URL into a filename-safe string and checks if the content has already been downloaded to avoid duplication.\nPage Navigation: Uses the headless browser to navigate to the URL, with a specified timeout to handle slow-loading pages.\nContent Saving: If the page loads successfully, its HTML content is saved to a file within the ‘HTML’ directory. If the page fails to load or an error occurs, the URL is added to a list of bad URLs for later reference.\n\nConcurrency Management: The script is designed to process multiple URLs in parallel, maximizing efficiency by utilizing asynchronous operations. This approach allows for faster completion of download tasks compared to sequential processing.\nError Handling: The script includes basic error handling to manage timeouts and other exceptions, ensuring that it can continue running even if some pages fail to load.\n\n\n# Ensure the HTML directory exists\nhtml_dir = \"HTML\"\nos.makedirs(html_dir, exist_ok=True)\n\n# User agent to be used for all requests\nua = \"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/16.6 Safari/605.1.15\"\nbad_urls = []\n\n\nasync def fetch(page, url, timeout=30):\n    # Slugify the URL to create a valid filename\n    filename = slugify(url) + \".html\"\n    file_path = os.path.join(html_dir, filename)\n\n    if os.path.isfile(file_path):\n        # print(f\"File {file_path} already exists, skipping download.\")\n        return\n\n    if url in bad_urls:\n        print(f\"Skipping bad URL: {url}\")\n        return\n\n    try:\n        # Set the user agent for the page\n        await page.setUserAgent(ua)\n\n        # Navigate to the page with a timeout\n        response = await asyncio.wait_for(\n            page.goto(url, {\"waitUntil\": \"networkidle0\"}), timeout\n        )\n\n        # Check if the page was successfully retrieved\n        if response and response.ok:\n            content = await page.content()\n            # Save the content to a file in the 'HTML' directory\n            with open(file_path, \"w\", encoding=\"utf-8\") as file:\n                file.write(content)\n            print(f\"Content from {url} has been saved to {file_path}\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Failed to retrieve {url}\")\n            bad_urls.append(url)\n    except asyncio.TimeoutError:\n        print(f\"Fetching {url} took too long and was cancelled.\")\n        bad_urls.append(url)\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred while fetching {url}: {e}\")\n        bad_urls.append(url)\n\nThis next section actual does the downloading by employing an asynchronous queue-based approach to manage URLs and distribute them across multiple browser pages for parallel processing. This method significantly improves efficiency by ensuring that each browser page is continuously utilized without idle time waiting for other pages to complete their tasks.\nKey components and functionalities:\n\nprocess_url Function: An asynchronous function that continuously processes URLs from a shared asyncio queue. Each browser page runs an instance of this function, fetching and processing URLs one after another until the queue is empty.\nmain Function Setup:\n\nBrowser and Page Initialization: Initializes a headless browser instance and opens a specified number of browser pages. 5 to 10 seems reasonable.\nURL Queue Creation: Prepares an asyncio queue and populates it with URLs to be processed. This queue acts as a shared resource for distributing URLs among the available pages.\n\nTask Management:\n\nAsynchronous Tasks: For each browser page, an asynchronous task is created to process URLs from the queue. These tasks run concurrently, allowing for simultaneous processing across pages.\nTask Synchronization: Utilizes asyncio.gather to wait for all tasks to complete before proceeding, ensuring that all URLs are processed before closing the browser and pages.\n\nResource Cleanup: After processing all URLs, the script ensures a clean shutdown by closing each browser page and the browser itself, releasing system resources.\nError Handling and Reporting: Tracks URLs that could not be downloaded for any reason, reporting them at the end of the execution for further analysis or retry.\n\n\nasync def process_url(page, url_queue):\n    while not url_queue.empty():\n        url = await url_queue.get()\n        await fetch(page, url)  # Your existing fetch function\n        url_queue.task_done()\n\nasync def main():\n    browser = await launch()\n    pages = [await browser.newPage() for _ in range(5)]  # Initialize pages once\n\n    # Create a queue of URLs\n    url_queue = asyncio.Queue()\n    for url in urls:\n        await url_queue.put(url)\n\n    # Create a task for each page to process URLs from the queue\n    tasks = [asyncio.create_task(process_url(page, url_queue)) for page in pages]\n\n    # Wait for all tasks to complete\n    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)\n\n    # Close pages and browser after all operations are complete\n    for page in pages:\n        await page.close()\n    await browser.close()\n\n    if bad_urls:\n        print(\"The following URLs had issues and were not downloaded:\")\n        print(\"\\n\".join(bad_urls))\n\nasyncio.run(main())\n\nFailed to retrieve https://www.wgmd.com/pro-palestinian-protesters-deface-veterans-cemetery-in-los-angeles-spray-paint-free-gaza/\nContent from

Sabrina Jordan lost her son in an officer-involved shooting in 2017 just outside of Dayton.\n\n“We’re just here also, to, like, celebrate and love each other,” Jordan, who is also OFUPAC’s founder, said. “You know, connect.”\n\nTania Hudson’s son was fatally shot by a Columbus police officer in 2015. \n\n“We’re asking accountability,” she said. “Officers be drug tested when they’re involved in a shooting, alcohol test. We understand that they have trauma and drama, too.”\n\nThe city’s police union, the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), said there is already accountability in place.\n\n“Accountability? How much more accountability can they ask for,” FOP Executive Vice President Brian Steel said. “We have an internal affairs. We have an inspector general’s office. We’re investigated by BCI in, say, a police-involved shooting, in a grand jury of our peers. There’s literally no more accountability that can be put on police officers today.”\n\n“Accountability is pretty much all that we can ask for,” Hudson said. “We can’t say justice – ours is gone. There will never be justice for us, but we’re out here trying to save other people’s lives. That’s why we’re constantly out here.”\n\nProtestors also mentioned their frustration with Marsy’s Law, which was originally passed to protect the victims of violent crimes, but which was extended to allow law enforcement departments to shield officers’ names when they are involved in a shooting. Protesters think this shouldn’t be the case while Steel said it’s an important protection for officers who are victims of violent crimes.\n\"\"\",\n    \"headline\": \"Statehouse protest calls for end to police brutality\",\n    \"publication-date\": \"2023-10-22\",\n    \"source\": \"WCMH\",\n}\n\n\ndef get_protest_details(article):\n    client = OpenAI(\n        max_retries=3,\n        timeout=20.0,\n    )\n\n    messages = [\n        {\n            \"role\": \"system\",\n            \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant that extracts summaries of newspaper articles about political protests as JSON for a database. \",\n        },\n        {\n            \"role\": \"user\",\n            \"content\": f\"\"\"Extract information about the details about a protest from the following article.\n      Only use information from the article.\n\n      {article}\n      \n      \"\"\",\n        },\n    ]\n\n    completion = client.chat.completions.create(\n        model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",  # model = 'gpt-4-turbo-preview',\n        functions=[\n            {\n                \"name\": \"protest_details\",\n                \"description\": \"Extract insights from media article about protest.\",\n                \"parameters\": Protest.model_json_schema(),\n            }\n        ],\n        n=1,\n        messages=messages,\n    )\n\n    r = json.loads(completion.choices[0].message.function_call.arguments)\n    return r\n    return pd.DataFrame(\n        [json.loads(c.message.function_call.arguments) for c in completion.choices]\n    )\n\n\nr = get_protest_details(article)\n\n\ndf = pd.json_normalize(\n    r, sep=\"_\"\n)  # It is returning some nested dictionaries, so I can't use the normal pd.from_json\ndf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsummary\nlocation_city\nlocation_state_abbreviation\nlocation_neighborhood\nlocation_moved\nsize_size_text\nsize_size_exact\nsize_size_estimate\nsize_size_cat\nparticipants_organizations\nparticipants_advocates\nparticipants_participant_type\nevent_date_event_date\nevent_date_day_of_week\nevent_date_date_text\n\n\n\n\n0\nYesterday was a national day of protest in Col...\nColumbus\nOH\nNone\nFalse\n[dozens, families]\nNone\n50\n1\n[Ohio Families United for Political Action and...\n[]\n[]\n2023-10-21\nSaturday\n[yesterday]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated cost:\n\ngpt-4-0125-preview: 55 articles for $1\ngpt-3.5-turbo: 1106 articles for $1\n\n\nProtest.model_json_schema()\n\n{'$defs': {'DateDetails': {'properties': {'event_date': {'description': 'Date of the protest.

This tape is a continuing series of interviews that contribute to the Gay and Lesbian Southern History Project, which is part of the Southern Oral History Program at UNC Chapel Hill. This project is currently focusing on the history of gay men, lesbians, bisexual and transgender history in Chapel Hill and the Triangle area over the 20th century. This tape will be stored in the Southern Historical Collection, which is located in Wilson Library on the campus of the University of North Carolina and Chapel Hill. The number for this tape is 02.23.02-QB.1. Here we go. Well, first off, Quentin, just to, this is a general question I ask everybody, tell me a little bit about where you were born, where you grew up, and just a general synopsis of the early years. The early years. The early years. I was born in Greenville, North Carolina, and I spent the first 18, 18 years there. I was born in a family of four children. I'm the youngest of four. My parents were laborers. My mother was the domestic, my father was a laborer. We lived in town at that time. Greenville was about 21,000 people. What did your father do? Did he work in textile mill? My father did various jobs. He worked in a furniture store. He sometimes worked in the fields, he worked in the tobacco factory, so that there was never one job, there was a serious variety of jobs. He even learned to repair televisions while he was working for...\n\n\nNow with speaker identification, powered by PyAnnote’s Speaker Diarization.\n\nfrom whisperplus import (\n    ASRDiarizationPipeline,\n    download_and_convert_to_mp3,\n    format_speech_to_dialogue,\n)\n\nmodel = 'openai/whisper-small' \naudio_path = 'sample/quiton_baxter_interview_sample.mp3'\ndevice = \"mps\"  # \"mps\" if you are on a modern Mac, \"cuda\" if have a GPU (the fastest option), or \"cpu\" (the slowest option). \n\npipeline = ASRDiarizationPipeline.from_pretrained(\n    asr_model=model,\n    diarizer_model=\"pyannote/speaker-diarization\",\n    use_auth_token='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', # This is mine.

The number for this tape is 02.23.02-QB.1. Here we go. Well, first off, Quentin, just to, this is a general question I ask everybody, tell me a little bit about where you were born, where you grew up, and just a general synopsis\nSpeaker 2:  of the early years. The early years. I was born in Greenville, North Carolina, and I spent the first 18, 18 years there. I was born in a family of four children. I'm the youngest of four. My parents were laborers. My mother was the domestic, my father was a laborer. We lived in town at that time. Greenville was about 21,000 people.\nSpeaker 1:  What did your father do? Did he work in textile mill?\nSpeaker 2:  My father did various jobs. He worked in a furniture store. He sometimes worked in the fields, he worked in the tobacco factory, so that there was never one job, there was a serious variety of jobs. He even learned to repair televisions while he was working for...\n\n\n\nThe transcription took less than 30 seconds (using the small model) for the 2-minute interview on my M2 MacBook Air with 8GBs of memory. In contrast, the full diarization took almost an hour, so you still might want to use Google Colab and a GPU."

To date, field experiments of labor market discrimination have generally drawn their sample of job postings from limited sources, often from a single major online job posting website. While providing a large pool of job postings across labor markets, this narrow sampling procedure leaves open questions about the generalizability of the findings from field experiments of racial discrimination in the extant literature. In this paper, w...\n\n\n6162\nField experiments using fictitious applications have become an increasingly important method for assessing hiring discrimination. Most field experiments of hiring, however, only observe whether the applicant receives an invitation to interview, called the “callback.” How adequate is our understanding of discrimination in the hiring process based on an assessment of discrimination in callbacks, when the ultimate subject of interest is discrimination in job offers? To address this question, we examine evidence from all available field experimental studies of racial or ethnic discrimination i...\n\n\n9168\nPrevious research has established that people shift their identities situationally and may come to subconsciously mirror one another. We explore this phenomenon among survey interviewers in the 2004-2018 General Social Survey by drawing on repeated measures of racial identification collected after each interview. We find not only that interviewers self-identify differently over time but also that their response changes cannot be fully explained by several measurement-error related expectations, either random or systematic. Rather, interviewers are significantly more likely to identify thei...\n\n\n9049\nHow do the demographic contexts of urban labor markets correlate with the extent to which racial and ethnic minorities are disadvantaged at the hiring stage? This paper builds on two branches of labor market stratification literature to link demographic contexts of labor markets to race- and ethnicity-based hiring discrimination that manifest within them. Relying on a unique large-scale field experiment that involved submitting nearly 12,000 fictitious resumes to real job postings across 50 major urban areas, I found that Black population size is associated with greater discrimination agai...\n\n\n4843\nHow do white observers react when people with black heritage assert a biracial, multiracial, or white identity rather than a black identity?

The results show that identity assertions influenced how white observers categorized applicants but not how they evaluated applicants.

Results seem encouraging.\nHow about an actual abstract?\n\nabstract = \"\"\"Black men and women have different levels of average educational attainment, yet\nfew studies have focused on explaining how and why these patterns develop. One\nexplanation may be inequality in experiences with institutional punishment\nthrough exclusionary school discipline and criminal justice exposure. Drawing on\nintersectional frameworks and theories of social control, I examine the long-\nterm association between punishment and the Black gender gap using data from the\nChildren of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 cohort (NLSY-C).\nDecomposition analyses reveal that about one third of the gender gap can be\nexplained by gender differences in experiences with institutional punishments,\nnet of differences in observed behaviors. These measures are predictive at key\neducational transition points, including finishing high school and earning a\n4-year college degree. Though Black boys and girls have similar family\nbackgrounds and grow up in similar neighborhoods, results suggest that Black\ngirls have a persistent advantage in educational attainment due in part to their\nlower levels of exposure to exclusionary school discipline and the criminal\njustice system. In addition, I find that gender differences in early\nachievement, early externalizing behavioral problems, school experiences, and\nsubstance use in adolescence and early adulthood are associated with gender\ndifferences in educational attainment.

Drawing on several lines of scholarship, the authors examined whether adolescents with incarcerated parents have fewer or lower quality relationships, participate in more antisocial peer networks, and feel less integrated or engaged in school. The study applies propensity score matching to survey and network data from a national sample of youth. Analyses indicated t...\n\n\n2378\nWhy do men in the United States today complete less schooling than women? One reason may be gender differences in early self-regulation and prosocial behaviors. Scholars have found that boys’ early behavioral disadvantage predicts their lower average academic achievement during elementary school. In this study, I examine longer-term effects: Do these early behavioral differences predict boys’ lower rates of high school graduation, college enrollment and graduation, and fewer years of schooling completed in adulthood? If so, through what pathways are they linked? I leverage a nationally rep...\n\n\n9104\nObjective: The goal of this study is to examine the association between parental incarceration and parent–youth closeness. Background: Despite the established complex repercussions of incarceration for relationships between adults, and the well-known intergenerational consequences of parental incarceration, little is known about how incarceration structures intergenerational relationships between parents and children. Methods: In this article, I use data from the Future of Families and Child Wellbeing Study (N = 3408), a cohort of children followed over a 15-year period, to examine how par...\n\n\n4611\nIn the present study, we examine the relationship between involvement in the criminal justice system and achieved socioeconomic status (SES), as well as the moderating effect of ascribed SES. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, we find a nonlinear relationship between criminal justice involvement and achieved SES, such that deeper involvement leads to increasingly negative consequences on achieved SES. Furthermore, those coming from the highest socioeconomic backgrounds are not \"protected\"from the deleterious consequences of system involvement, bu...\n\n\n5538\nResearch has documented a negative association between women’s educational attainment and early sexual intercourse, union formation, and pregnancy. However, the implications that school progression relative to age may have for the timing and order of such transitions are poorly understood.

Using month of birth and age-at-school-entry policies to estimate the effect of advanced school progression by age, I show that it accelerates th...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPretty good, although maybe skewing a bit too much towards parental incarceration.\nWhat about articles on the same topic focusing on Latino/Latinas?\n\nr = transform_and_match_df(\n    text=abstract,\n    remove_concept=\"African American, Black\",\n    add_concept = \"Latino, Latina, Hispanic\",\n    df= df,\n    feature_name = \"abstract_encodings\",\n    n=5,\n)\nr[[\"Abstract\"]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\n\n2513\nThe socializing power of the prison is routinely discussed as a prisonization process in which inmates learn to conform to life in the correctional facility.

In this article I use ethnographic data collected over fifteen months in two juvenile justice facilities and interviews with twenty-four probation youth to examine how the identities socialized among Latino prison inmates spill over into high-incarce...\n\n\n4732\nUsing a nationally representative sample of approximately 3,500 public schools, this study builds on and extends our knowledge of how ‘‘minority threat’’ manifests within schools. We test whether various disciplinary policies and practices are mobilized in accordance with Latino/a student composition, presumably the result of a group response to perceptions that white racial dominance is jeopardized.

We find steep increases across birth cohorts in the proportion of women who have had sex with both men and women since age 18, whereas increases for men are less steep.

Two of these configurations hold unified progressive or regressive racial and gender attitudes.
