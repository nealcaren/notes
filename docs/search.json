Drawing on my research on nationalist movements, I discuss the narrative flexibility and emotional power of nationalism and consider how these characteristics fuel a particularly resentful form of majoritarian nationalism—MAGAism. I identify five points of entry for MAGA participation, starting with this bitter majoritarian nationalism, then populism, then traditional conservatism, next a Trumpian personality cult, and ending with the alt-right’s extreme white supremacism and fascism. I then discuss two forces that gather this unlikely collection of groups and individuals under the MAGA umbrella: (1) the flexibility of social identity and how it allows status-threat narratives to subsume and redirect economic and political claims; (2) the social media environment of the 2020s, cut loose from the traditional gatekeepers of news and information, wherein maximizing hits—not accuracy—is the guiding principle. On the one hand, social media intensify the prominence of the demagogic celebrity at the helm of the Republican Party, Donald J. Trump. On the other hand, alt-right trolls compete for prominence by seeking outrageousness and shock value, enhanced by algorithms that create a closed information environment. These social media trends pull MAGA adherents further to the right by inflaming public discourse and building the movement on lies and conspiracies.\nINTRODUCTION: The rise of far right-wing parties and extremist groups is now a topic of deep concern among social scientists who study collective action and contentious politics.  As a reader of this special issue of Mobilization, this trend no doubt has been on your mind a lot, as it has been on mine—especially the challenges it poses to democratic institutions.i In the U.S. today, one of the major political parties actively restricts voting rights, bans books in libraries, embraces conspiracies, flaunts constitutional principles, and limits public-school curricula on topics such as diversity, slavery, gender and sexuality (Natanson 2023a, 2023b)—and millions of MAGA supporters are okay with it (Baker, Perry, and Whitehead, 2020; Enders, Farhart, Miller, and Uscinski 2022; Graham et al. 2021; Stewart 2023). Further along the right-wing spectrum, one increasingly finds rising antisemitism, white Christian nationalism, gun-toting bullies, and misogynists (see Davis and Kettrey’s study in this issue) in the U.S. public sphere, raising parallels with European history in the early twentieth century and its brown shirts and black shirts (rather than today’s polo shirts and tac gear). While violence and intolerance are not unique to the extreme right, these trends reflect a synergy between the current political environment, eroding democratic norms, and—among more and more citizens in democratic states—authoritarian and even fascist tendencies (Jackson 2021; Wintemute, Robinson, Tomish 2022). In the U.S. these trends can be grouped under the umbrella of MAGAism where majoritarian nationalism mixes with populism, far-right extremism, and a virtual (in both meanings of the term) potpourri of themes such as antiwokeness, antivaccines, parental rights, gun rights, sovereign citizenry, science denial, masculinity, the lie of a stolen 2020 election, Trumpian personality cult, white replacement, QAnon conspiracies, among many others. This essay contextualizes the special issue articles by situating them in relation to trends in the U.S., which I discuss under the big umbrella of MAGAism. Following Tarrow (2021: 175), common usage in the popular press, and Trump himself, I consider MAGAism as a general social movement, one that encompasses the rightward shift of public discourse and politics in the U.S. plus the array of mobilizing groups that drive it.ii  I will offer a somewhat personalized essay that draws on insights from my work on the power (and danger) of nationalism to analyze a particularly resentful majoritarian nationalism—often labeled white nationalism in the U.S.  (Graham et al. 2021; Mudde 2019, Miller-Idriss, 2021; Young 2017). I am interested not only in militias, alt-right trolls, and white-supremacist churches,  but—more broadly—the mechanisms that allow these extremists to be grouped with millions of middle-class working citizens who come to the movement via parental-rights groups, suburban bible-study groups, or as antivaxxers, tradition-alists, or Constitutionalists.  MAGAism is a big-tent collective action—a movement with continuity, shared identity, diverse claims and political objectives, networked by an array of groups and organizations—the movement’s mobilizing structures that mostly stand apart from the Republican Party. I will identify the movement’s patterns of discourse and how it is structured to help understand the complexity, die-hard loyalty, denialism, and conspiracies that unite millions of MAGAistas in the face of factual evidence that should undermine their beliefs. I pose the fundamental question of collective action: how is the MAGA movement possible?  \n'''\n\n\ndef make_tweets(article):\n    client = OpenAI(\n        max_retries=3,\n        timeout=80.0,\n    )\n\n    messages = [\n        {\n            \"role\": \"system\",\n            \"content\": ''' You write a variety of different types of social media posts about sociology articles.\nIf you perform well, everyone gets a raise, while there are negative consequences if the posts don't get views.\nNEVER USE HASHTAGS.\n''',\n        },\n        {\n            \"role\": \"user\",\n            \"content\": f\"\"\"Generate ten tweets using each style about this sociology article:\n\n            \n      {article}\n      \n      \"\"\",\n        },\n    ]\n\n    completion = client.chat.completions.create(\n        model = 'gpt-4-turbo-preview',     #   model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\" is 20x cheaper but isn't as insightiful\n        functions=[\n            {\n                \"name\": \"generate_tweets\",\n                \"description\": \"Create social media posts based on an article abstract.\",\n                \"parameters\": GenerateTweets.model_json_schema(),\n            },\n        ],\n        n=1,\n        messages=messages,\n    )\n    r = json.loads(completion.choices[0].message.function_call.arguments)\n    tweets = [{'type': tweet_type.split('_')[0], 'text': t['content']} for tweet_type in r for t in r[tweet_type]]\n    \n    #return tweets\n\n    return pd.DataFrame(tweets)\n\n\nr = make_tweets(article)\n\n\nr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntype\ntext\n\n\n\n\n0\nsummary\nHank Johnston explores MAGAism's big tent approach in \"THE MAGA MOVEMENT’S BIG UMBRELLA,\" highlighting its blend of nationalism, populism, and far-right extremism. #Mobilization\n\n\n1\nsummary\nJohnston's article dives into how MAGAism merges majority nationalism with various forms of right-wing extremism, offering a comprehensive analysis of its persistence. #MobilizationJournal\n\n\n2\nsummary\n\"THE MAGA MOVEMENT’S BIG UMBRELLA\" outlines five key entry points into MAGAism, from majoritarian nationalism to extreme white supremacism. #Sociology\n\n\n3\nsummary\nJohnston examines the role of social media in magnifying MAGAism, from spreading misinformation to fueling far-right extremism. #DigitalSociety\n\n\n4\nsummary\nThe dynamics of MAGAism's growth are dissected in Hank Johnston's recent article, showing how diverse groups unite under its banner. #PoliticalMovements\n\n\n5\ninsight\nMAGAism draws power from a \"big-umbrella\" strategy, showing the complexity of modern social movements. #HankJohnston\n\n\n6\ninsight\nEmotional narratives and flexible identities are key to MAGA's cohesion, despite its diverse constituents. #SocialIdentity\n\n\n7\ninsight\nSocial media's role in modern politics is undeniable, as seen in MAGA's growth.

Sabrina Jordan lost her son in an officer-involved shooting in 2017 just outside of Dayton.\n\n“We’re just here also, to, like, celebrate and love each other,” Jordan, who is also OFUPAC’s founder, said. “You know, connect.”\n\nTania Hudson’s son was fatally shot by a Columbus police officer in 2015. \n\n“We’re asking accountability,” she said. “Officers be drug tested when they’re involved in a shooting, alcohol test. We understand that they have trauma and drama, too.”\n\nThe city’s police union, the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), said there is already accountability in place.\n\n“Accountability? How much more accountability can they ask for,” FOP Executive Vice President Brian Steel said. “We have an internal affairs. We have an inspector general’s office. We’re investigated by BCI in, say, a police-involved shooting, in a grand jury of our peers. There’s literally no more accountability that can be put on police officers today.”\n\n“Accountability is pretty much all that we can ask for,” Hudson said. “We can’t say justice – ours is gone. There will never be justice for us, but we’re out here trying to save other people’s lives. That’s why we’re constantly out here.”\n\nProtestors also mentioned their frustration with Marsy’s Law, which was originally passed to protect the victims of violent crimes, but which was extended to allow law enforcement departments to shield officers’ names when they are involved in a shooting. Protesters think this shouldn’t be the case while Steel said it’s an important protection for officers who are victims of violent crimes.\n\"\"\",\n    \"headline\": \"Statehouse protest calls for end to police brutality\",\n    \"publication-date\": \"2023-10-22\",\n    \"source\": \"WCMH\",\n}\n\n\ndef get_protest_details(article):\n    client = OpenAI(\n        max_retries=3,\n        timeout=20.0,\n    )\n\n    messages = [\n        {\n            \"role\": \"system\",\n            \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant that extracts summaries of newspaper articles about political protests as JSON for a database. \",\n        },\n        {\n            \"role\": \"user\",\n            \"content\": f\"\"\"Extract information about the details about a protest from the following article.\n      Only use information from the article.\n\n      {article}\n      \n      \"\"\",\n        },\n    ]\n\n    completion = client.chat.completions.create(\n        model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",  # model = 'gpt-4-turbo-preview',\n        functions=[\n            {\n                \"name\": \"protest_details\",\n                \"description\": \"Extract insights from media article about protest.\",\n                \"parameters\": Protest.model_json_schema(),\n            }\n        ],\n        n=1,\n        messages=messages,\n    )\n\n    r = json.loads(completion.choices[0].message.function_call.arguments)\n    return r\n    return pd.DataFrame(\n        [json.loads(c.message.function_call.arguments) for c in completion.choices]\n    )\n\n\nr = get_protest_details(article)\n\n\ndf = pd.json_normalize(\n    r, sep=\"_\"\n)  # It is returning some nested dictionaries, so I can't use the normal pd.from_json\ndf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsummary\nlocation_city\nlocation_state_abbreviation\nlocation_neighborhood\nlocation_moved\nsize_size_text\nsize_size_exact\nsize_size_estimate\nsize_size_cat\nparticipants_organizations\nparticipants_advocates\nparticipants_participant_type\nevent_date_event_date\nevent_date_day_of_week\nevent_date_date_text\n\n\n\n\n0\nYesterday was a national day of protest in Col...\nColumbus\nOH\nNone\nFalse\n[dozens, families]\nNone\n50\n1\n[Ohio Families United for Political Action and...\n[]\n[]\n2023-10-21\nSaturday\n[yesterday]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated cost:\n\ngpt-4-0125-preview: 55 articles for $1\ngpt-3.5-turbo: 1106 articles for $1\n\n\nProtest.model_json_schema()\n\n{'$defs': {'DateDetails': {'properties': {'event_date': {'description': 'Date of the protest.
